  abstract = {Instead of the industrial production, which drove economic growth in the 20th century, the driver for growth in the 21st century is productivity in knowledge work and service businesses. For this reason, the authors developed a technique for measuring happiness using wearable technology. The research found a hidden signal representing a person’s happiness within the basic pattern of physical activity known as the “1/T rule.” This result uncovered a close relationship between the “trinity” of physical activity = happiness = productivity. Combined with a technique for using artificial intelligence to generate KPIs automatically, the technology can foster the ability of groups to engage in “co-creation” while also encouraging autonomy and commitment in individuals. This new technology is recognized as having the potential to open up new pathways in corporate accounting, production, and human resource systems.},

  isbn = {978-0-19-958829-9},
  abstract = {We are told that 'work is good for us' and that ill health is caused by 'individual lifestyles'. Drawing on research from public health, social policy, epidemiology, geography and political science, this evidence-based inter-disciplinary book firmly challenges these contemporary orthodoxies. It systematically demonstrates that work - or lack of it - is central to our health and wellbeing and is the underlying determinant of health inequalities. Work is the cornerstone of modern society and dominates adult life with around a third of our time spent working. It is a vital part of self-identity and for most of us it is the foundation of economic and social status. As such, the material and psychosocial conditions in which we work have immense consequences for our physical and mental wellbeing, as well as the distribution of health across the population. Recessions, job-loss, insecurity and unemployment also have important ramifications for the health and wellbeing of individuals, families and communities. Chronic illness is itself a significant cause of worklessness and low pay. Drawing on examples from different countries, this book shows that the relationship between work, worklessness and health varies by country. Countries with a more regulated work environment and a more interventionist and supportive welfare system have better health and smaller work-related health inequalities. The book provides examples of specific policies and interventions that mitigate the ill-health effects of work and worklessness. It concludes by asserting the importance of politics and policy choices in the aetiology of health and health inequalities.},

  abstract = {In liberal political theory, meaningful work is conceptualised as a preference in the market. Although this strategy avoids transgressing liberal neutrality, the subsequent constraint upon state intervention aimed at promoting the social and economic conditions for widespread meaningful work is normatively unsatisfactory. Instead, meaningful work can be understood to be a fundamental human need, which all persons require in order to satisfy their inescapable interests in freedom, autonomy, and dignity. To overcome the inadequate treatment of meaningful work by liberal political theory, I situate the good of meaningful work within a liberal perfectionist framework, from which standpoint I develop a normative justification for making meaningful work the object of political action. To understand the content of meaningful work, I make use of Susan Wolf’s distinct value of meaningfulness, in which she brings together the dimensions of objectivity and subjectivity into the ‘bipartite value’ of meaningfulness (BVM) (Wolf, Meaning in life and why it matters, 2010). However, in order to be able to incorporate the BVM into our lives, we must become valuers, that is, co-creators of values and meanings. This demands that we acquire the relevant capabilities and status as co-authorities in the realm of value. I conclude that meaningful work is of first importance because it is a fundamental human need, and that society ought to be arranged to allow as many people as possible to experience their work as meaningful through the development of the relevant capabilities.},

For growth, higher inequality tends to retard growth in poor countries and encourage growth in richer places. The Kuznets curve -- whereby inequality first increases and later decreases during the process of economic development -- emerges as a clear empirical regularity. However, this relation does not explain the bulk of variations in inequality across countries or over time.},

  doi = {10.1111/tops.12150},
  abstract = {We consider a situation in which individuals search for accurate decisions without direct feedback on their accuracy, but with information about the decisions made by peers in their group. The ``wisdom of crowds'' hypothesis states that the average judgment of many individuals can give a good estimate of, for example, the outcomes of sporting events and the answers to trivia questions. Two conditions for the application of wisdom of crowds are that estimates should be independent and unbiased. Here, we study how individuals integrate social information when answering trivia questions with answers that range between 0\% and 100\% (e.g., ``What percentage of Americans are left-handed?''). We find that, consistent with the wisdom of crowds hypothesis, average performance improves with group size. However, individuals show a consistent bias to produce estimates that are insufficiently extreme. We find that social information provides significant, albeit small, improvement to group performance. Outliers with answers far from the correct answer move toward the position of the group mean. Given that these outliers also tend to be nearer to 50\% than do the answers of other group members, this move creates group polarization away from 50\%. By looking at individual performance over different questions we find that some people are more likely to be affected by social influence than others. There is also evidence that people differ in their competence in answering questions, but lack of competence is not significantly correlated with willingness to change guesses. We develop a mathematical model based on these results that postulates a cognitive process in which people first decide whether to take into account peer guesses, and if so, to move in the direction of these guesses. The size of the move is proportional to the distance between their own guess and the average guess of the group. This model closely approximates the distribution of guess movements and shows how outlying incorrect opinions can be systematically removed from a group resulting, in some situations, in improved group performance. However, improvement is only predicted for cases in which the initial guesses of individuals in the group are biased.},

  abstract = {Affect Control Theory is a mathematical representation of the interactions between two persons, in which it is posited that people behave in a way so as to minimize the amount of deflection between their cultural emotional sentiments and the transient emotional sentiments that are created by each situation. Affect Control Theory presents a maximum likelihood solution in which optimal behaviours or identities can be predicted based on past interactions. Here, we formulate a probabilistic and decision theoretic model of the same underlying principles, and show this to be a generalisation of the basic theory. The model is more expressive than the original theory, as it can maintain multiple hypotheses about behaviours and identities simultaneously as a probability distribution. This allows the model to generate affectively believable interactions with people by learning about their identity and predicting their behaviours. We demonstrate this generalisation with a set of simulations. We then show how our model can be used as an emotional "plug-in" for systems that interact with humans. We demonstrate human-interactive capability by building a simple intelligent tutoring application and pilot-testing it in an experiment with 20 participants.},

  volume = {120},
  doi = {10.1037/a0030972},
  abstract = {The priming of concepts has been shown to influence peoples' subsequent actions, often unconsciously. We propose 3 mechanisms (psychological, cultural, and biological) as a unified explanation of such effects. (a) Primed concepts influence holistic representations of situations by parallel constraint satisfaction. (b) The constraints among representations stem from culturally shared affective meanings of concepts acquired in socialization. (c) Patterns of activity in neural populations act as semantic pointers linking symbolic concepts to underlying emotional and sensorimotor representations and thereby causing action. We present 2 computational models of behavioral priming that implement the proposed mechanisms. One is a localist neural network that connects primes with behaviors through central nodes simulating affective meanings. In a series of simulations, where the input is based on empirical data, we show that this model can explain a wide variety of experimental findings related to automatic social behavior. The second, neurocomputational model simulates spiking patterns in populations of biologically realistic neurons. We use this model to demonstrate how the proposed mechanisms can be implemented in the brain. Finally, we discuss how our models integrate previous theoretical accounts of priming phenomena. We also examine the interactions of psychological, cultural, and biological mechanisms in the control of automatic social behavior.},

  volume = {108},
  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1008636108},
  abstract = {Social groups can be remarkably smart and knowledgeable when their averaged judgements are compared with the judgements of individuals. Already Galton [Galton F (1907) Nature 75:7] found evidence that the median estimate of a group can be more accurate than estimates of experts. This wisdom of crowd effect was recently supported by examples from stock markets, political elections, and quiz shows [Surowiecki J (2004) The Wisdom of Crowds]. In contrast, we demonstrate by experimental evidence (N = 144) that even mild social influence can undermine the wisdom of crowd effect in simple estimation tasks. In the experiment, subjects could reconsider their response to factual questions after having received average or full information of the responses of other subjects. We compare subjects' convergence of estimates and improvements in accuracy over five consecutive estimation periods with a control condition, in which no information about others' responses was provided. Although groups are initially ''wise,'' knowledge about estimates of others narrows the diversity of opinions to such an extent that it undermines the wisdom of crowd effect in three different ways. The ''social influence effect'' diminishes the diversity of the crowd without improvements of its collective error. The ''range reduction effect'' moves the position of the truth to peripheral regions of the range of estimates so that the crowd becomes less reliable in providing expertise for external observers. The ''confidence effect'' boosts individuals' confidence after convergence of their estimates despite lack of improved accuracy. Examples of the revealed mechanism range from misled elites to the recent global financial crisis.},

Cooperation means that selfish replicators forgo some of their reproductive potential to help one another. But natural selection implies competition and therefore opposes cooperation unless a specific mechanism is at work. Here I discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and group selection. For each mechanism, a simple rule is derived that specifies whether natural selection can lead to cooperation.},

This paper discusses various approaches to political economy and develops the argument that there are strong empirical and theoretical grounds for believing that inefficient policies and institutions are prevalent. We conclude that these inefficient institutions and policies are chosen because they serve the interests of politicians or social groups that hold political power at the expense of the rest. The theoretical case depends on commitment problems inherent in politics; parties holding political power cannot make commitments to bind their future actions because there is no outside agency with the coercive capacity to enforce such arrangements.

It does so by addressing three main issues: the properties and reliability of the income distribution data, the robustness of the reduced form relationships between income distribution and growth estimated so far, and the specific channels through which income distribution affects growth. The main conclusion in this regard is that there is strong empirical support for two types of explanations, linking income distribution to sociopolitical instability and to the education/fertility decision. A third channel, based on the interplay of borrowing constraints and investment in human capital, also seems to receive some support by the data, although it is probably the hardest to test with the existing data. By contrast, there appears to be less empirical support for explanations based on the effects of income distribution on fiscal policy.},

It uses an improved data set on income inequality which not only reduces measurement error, but also allows estimation via a panel technique. Panel estimation makes it possible to control for time-invariant country-specific effects, therefore eliminating a potential source of omitted-variable bias. Results suggest that in the short and medium term, an increase in a country's level of income inequality has a significant positive relationship with subsequent economic growth. This relationship is highly robust across samples, variable definitions, and model specifications.},

This paper asks whether there is a simple common principle that can explain this puzzling evidence. We show that if some people care about equity the puzzles can be resolved. It turns out that the economic environment determines whether the fair types or the selfish types dominate equilibrium behavior.},

  abstract = {We study the structure of optimal wedges and capital taxes in a dynamic Mirrlees economy with endogenous distribution of skills. Human capital is a private, stochastic state variable that drives the skill process of each individual. Building on the findings of the labor literature, we construct a tractable life-cycle model of human capital evolution with risky investment and stochastic depreciation. In this setting, we demonstrate the optimality of (a) a human capital premium, i.e., an excess return on human capital relative to physical capital, (b) a large intertemporal wedge early in the life-cycle, and (c) a non-zero intratemporal wedge even at the top of the skill distribution at all dates except the last date in the life-cycle. The main implication for the structure of optimal linear capital taxes is the necessity of deferred taxation of physical capital. The average marginal tax rate on physical capital held in every period is zero in present value. However, expected capital tax payments do not equal zero in every period. Necessarily, agents face negative expected capital tax payments early in the life-cycle and positive expected capital tax payments late in the life-cycle.},

  abstract = {Substantial prior literature has established that subjects in laboratory experiments are typically willing to sacrifice their own well being to make financial allocations more equal among participants. We test the applicability of this result in an environment that contains some of the key contextual issues that are usually excluded from more abstract games, but which might be important in situations involving income redistribution. Our general finding is that votes for a redistributive tax are almost entirely in accordance with self-interest: above-average earners vote for low tax rates and below-average earners vote for high tax rates. A measure of subjects' preferences for fairness or equality, their self-reported economic ideology, is not directly related to their voting behavior in this experiment. Because the ideology measure should be correlated with any intrinsic preferences regarding inequality aversion, we conclude that any preferences for fairness or inequality that our subjects possess are not strong enough to overcome self-interest in this context. We do, however, find evidence for a possible indirect effect of ideology on choice behavior in that more conservative subjects tend to be more responsive to their self-interest than the more liberal subjects.

Fernandez and Rodrik (1991) hold that anti-reform bias can be attributed to individual-specific uncertainty regarding the distribution of gains and losses resulting from a reform. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate that anti-reform bias arising from uncertainty is mitigated by social preferences. We show that, paradoxically, many who stand to lose from reforms vote in favor because they value efficiency, while many who will potentially gain from reforms oppose them due to inequality aversion.},

The findings support the hypothesis that ideology is associated with a person's willingness to use redistribution to reduce income inequality that is caused by luck, but it is not related to preferences for inequality that are not related to luck.},

Deliberation, however, significantly diminishes institutional differences and uniformly improves efficiency. Furthermore, communication protocols exhibit an array of stable attributes: messages are public, consistently reveal private information, provide a good predictor for ultimate group choices, and follow particular (endogenous) sequencing.},

However, an examination of the work of John Dewey reveals that pragmatism is incompatible with the conception of knowledge which now prevails in these sciences as well as the relationship currently established between this form of inquiry and the state. Fidelity to pragmatism requires a fundamental reconceptualization of the practice of social science and a reconsideration of the organization of knowledge and power in a democratic society.},

  isbn = {9780465050970 (hardback)},
  abstract = {"In The Great Debate Yuval Levin explores the origins of the familiar left/right divide in American politics by examining the views of the men who best represent each side of that debate: Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine. In a groundbreaking exploration of the origins of our political order, Levin shows that our political divide did not originate (as many historians argue) in the French Revolution, but rather in the Anglo-American debate about that revolution. Burke and Paine were both utterly fascinating figures--active in politics, versed in philosophy, and two of the best, most effective and powerful political writers and polemicists in the history of the English speaking world. Levin sets the work of these two men against the dramatic history of their era and shows how they mixed theory and practice to advance their very different notions of liberty, equality, nature, history, reason, revolution, and reform. Paine believed in radical change and saw the American and French Revolutions as catalysts for creating a new society; Burke believed in a significantly more gradual approach with each generation acting merely as part of a long chain of history. These differing approaches to revolution and reform created a division that continues to shape our current political discourse--including issues ranging from gun control and abortion to welfare and economic reform"--},

It also explores their uses in everyday language and action, how they are understood in psychology and how they figure in philosophical reflection on action and morality. The book clarifies and for the most part defends the way in which economists invoke preferences to explain, predict and assess behavior and outcomes. Hausman argues, however, that the predictions and explanations economists offer rely on theories of preference formation that are in need of further development, and he criticizes attempts to define welfare in terms of preferences and to define preferences in terms of choices or self-interest. The analysis clarifies the relations between rational choice theory and philosophical accounts of human action. The book also assembles the materials out of which models of preference formation and modification can be constructed, and it comments on how reason and emotion shape preferences"--},

  abstract = {Bei der Einreise in die Schweiz wird Mr. White festgenommen, weil er für die Grenzpolizei mit dem verschwundenen Bildhauer Anatol Ludwig Stiller identisch ist. Frühere Freunde, sein Bruder, seine Frau Julika und der Staatsanwalt bestätigen in Aussagen und gemeinsamen Erinnerungen diesen Verdacht. Die Aufzeichnungen des Mr. White in der Untersuchungshaft aber wehren sich gegen diese Festlegung mit der Behauptung: »Ich bin nicht Stiller!« In immer neuen Erzählungen will er dieser Fixierung entgehen, weil ihm diese Identität fragwürdig geworden ist und weil er sich die Freiheit der Wahl, ein anderer zu sein, erhalten will. - »Das Ich wird eine Behauptung der Welt, der man eine Gegenbehauptung, ein Nicht-Ich entgegenstellt. Anders gesagt: an Stelle des Ichs tritt ein fingiertes Ich, und das Ich wird ein Objekt. Romantechnisch gesehen: das Ich wird ein Kriminalfall. Einfacher ausgedrückt: Frisch hat sich durch diese Form, die gleichzeitig Handlung, gleichzeitig Problematik ist, in einen anderen verwandelt, der nun erzählt, nicht von Stiller zuerst, sondern von sich, von White eben, für den Stiller der andere ist, für den er sich nun zu interessieren beginnt und dem er nachforscht, weil man doch ständig behauptet, er sei mit ihm identisch. Gerade durch diese Romanform wird so Selbstdarstellung möglich, gesetzt -, der Leser mache auch mit, spiele mit. Ohne Mitmachen ist der Stiller weder zu lesen noch zu begreifen.« Friedrich Dürrenmatt},

  abstract = {A manual for survival and success that asks the most important question today's leaders, in any industry, can ask themselves: What would Google do? To demonstrate how to emulate Google, Jarvis lays out his laws of what he calls "the new Google century," including such insights as: Think distributed; Become a platform; Join the post-scarcity, open-source, gift economy; The middleman has died; Your worst customers are your best friends and your best customers are your partners; Do what you do best and link to the rest; Get out of the way; Make mistakes well; and more. He applies these principles not just to emerging technologies and the Internet, but to other industries--telecommunications, airlines, television, government, healthcare, education, journalism, and, yes, book publishing--showing ultimately what the world would look like if Google ran it. The result will change the way readers ask questions and solve problems.--From publisher description},

A studious, law-abiding, intense youngster from Newark, New Jersey, Marcus Messner, is beginning his sophomore year on the pastoral, conservative campus of Ohio's Winesburg College. And why is he there and not at the local college in Newark where he originally enrolled? Because his father, the sturdy, hard-working neighborhood butcher, seems to have gone mad--mad with fear and apprehension of the dangers of adult life, the dangers of the world, the dangers he sees in every corner for his beloved boy. As the long-suffering, desperately harassed mother tells her son, the father's fear arises from love and pride. Perhaps, but it produces too much anger in Marcus for him to endure living with his parents any longer. He leaves them and, far from Newark, in the midwestern college, has to find his way amid the customs and constrictions of another American world.--From publisher's description},

  abstract = {Our politicians insist that we live in a time of unprecedented prosperity, yet more and more Americans are pointing out that the richest 1\% of our society holds more wealth than the bottom 90\% put together. In this timely book, economist Philippe Van Parijs has a simple plan for addressing not only poverty but other social ills: everyone would be paid a universal basic income (UBI) at a level sufficient for subsistence. Everyone, including "those who make no social contribution-who spend their mornings bickering with their partner, surf off Malibu in the afternoon, and smoke pot all night."Van Parijs argues that a UBI would reduce unemployment, improve women's lives, and prevent the environmental damage caused by overproduction and fast growth. At the heart of his proposal is the intention to secure real freedom for all, because it offers the greatest possible opportunity to those with the least opportunities. He acknowledges that an idle surfer might not deserve a UBI, but that the surfer's good luck would be no different than the good fortune enjoyed by those who benefit from the current distribution of resources.Responses to this controversial proposal vary: Some are in favor of a basic income, but only if it's tied to work. Others find the entire proposal unrealistic and unaffordable. Almost all agree, however, that it is time for us to talk about this issue.NEW DEMOCRACY FORUM: A series of short paperback originals exploring creative solutions to our most urgent national concerns. The series editors (for Boston Review), Joshua Cohen and Joel Rogers, aim to foster politically engaged, intellectually honest, and morally serious debate about fundamental issues-both on and off the agenda of conventional politics.},

  shorttitle = {The Constitution of Liberty},
  abstract = {From the 700 billion bailout of the banking industry to president Barack Obama\&\#8217;s 787 billion stimulus package to the highly controversial passage of federal health-care reform, conservatives and concerned citizens alike have grown increasingly fearful of big government. Enter Nobel Prize\&\#8211;winning economist and political theorist F. A. Hayek, whose passionate warning against empowering states with greater economic control, The Road to Serfdom, became an overnight sensation last summer when it was endorsed by Glenn Beck. The book has since sold over 150,000 copies.The latest entry in the University of Chicago Press\&\#8217;s series of newly edited editions of Hayek\&\#8217;s works, The Constitution of Liberty is, like Serfdom, just as relevant to our present moment. The book is considered Hayek\&\#8217;s classic statement on the ideals of freedom and liberty, ideals that he believes have guided\&\#8212;and must continue to guide\&\#8212;the growth of Western civilization. Here Hayek defends the principles of a free society, casting a skeptical eye on the growth of the welfare state and examining the challenges to freedom posed by an ever expanding government\&\#8212;as well as its corrosive effect on the creation, preservation, and utilization of knowledge. In opposition to those who call for the state to play a greater role in society, Hayek puts forward a nuanced argument for prudence. Guided by this quality, he elegantly demonstrates that a free market system in a democratic polity\&\#8212;under the rule of law and with strong constitutional protections of individual rights\&\#8212;represents the best chance for the continuing existence of liberty.},

Dass es eine Freiheit vor dem Liberalismus gibt, hat Quentin Skinner gezeigt; und davon, dass es auch eine danach gibt, leben die Postmodernen: Sie entdecken "Kinder der Freiheit", deren erfrischende Spontaneität nichts mehr mit der pflichtgemäßen Vernünftigkeit früherer Generationen zu tun hat. Zur Genüge diskutiert worden ist schließlich, dass selbst innerhalb des Liberalismus zahllose Stadien oder Varianten mit je eigenen Freiheitsgraden einander abgelöst haben.Durch das Dickicht all dieser Freiheiten schlägt diese Arbeit eine Schneise und verbindet dabei systematische mit historischen Überlegungen.},

Tiere sind denkende Wesen, und der Mensch ist schon als Tier ein denkendes Wesen. Allerdings unterscheidet er sich dadurch vom Tier, dass er eine kulturelle Welt hervorgebracht hat, die ihn weit über das tierliche Bewusstsein hinausblicken lässt. Ausgehend von neuen Untersuchungen aus der Verhaltensforschung zu Affen, Krähen und anderen Tieren und den Überlegungen von Philosophen wie Descartes, Darwin, Davidson, Dretske oder Derrida spannt dieser Band ein Panorama des Nachdenkens über Tiere auf, das auch den Blick auf den Menschen verändert.},

  isbn = {978-3-03734-116-2},
  abstract = {Angesichts der Ereignisstürme im gegenwärtigen Finanzgeschäft widmet sich Joseph Vogl in einem klarsichtigen Essay den Wahrnehmungsweisen, Theorien und Problemlagen dessen, was man mit gutem Grund immer noch Kapitalismus nennen muss. Gerade Finanzmärkte gelten als das Marktgeschehen schlechthin. Unbelastet von den Beschwernissen der Produktion sind sie - für die herrschende ökonomische Doktrin - Schauplätze eines perfekten Wettbewerbs und idealer wirtschaftlicher Ausgleichprozesse: ein segensreiches Zusammenspiel von gewinnorientierten und also ebenso rationalen wie zuverlässigen Akteuren. Darum wollte man in Spekulationsblasen und Crashs bloße Anpassungskrisen oder jene seltenen Ausnahmesituationen erkennen, die sich dem irrationalen Überschwang eines vielleicht gierigen, vielleicht inkompetenten oder schlicht rücksichtslosen Spekulationswesens verdanken. Hier setzen die Fragen des Essays an: Sind die irrationalen Exuberanzen wirklich Ausnahmefälle oder nicht eher reguläre Prozesse im Getriebe kapitalistischer Ökonomien? Reicht die Unterscheidung von rational und irrational überhaupt hin, die Effekte dieses Systems zu fassen? Begegnet ökonomische Rationalität hier nicht unmittelbar ihrer eigenen Unvernunft? Arbeitet das System tatsächlich effizient und rational?Angesichts dieser Fragen folgt der Essay einer ebenso historischen wie theoretischen Sondierung und hegt einen grundlegenden Zweifel darüber, ob die alte liberale Hoffnung auf die ausgleichende Ordnungsmacht des Marktes Adam Smiths berühmte »unsichtbare Hand« noch gerechtfertigt ist. So wenig der Kapitalismus als reiner Rationalisierungsprozess beschrieben werden kann, so wenig lassen sich Spekulation und Spekulanten als verworfene oder pathologische Ausnahmegestalten begreifen. Das liegt nicht zuletzt an den Dynamiken der modernen Finanz- und Kreditökonomie, die sich auf die Wirkungsweise einer stets offenen und ungewissen Zukunft verpflichtet. Für die Märkte der futures und Derivate ist Zukunft, d.h. Zeit zu einer unerschöpflichen Ressource geworden. Im Zentrum steht das Wissen um jene scheinbar irregulären Ereignisse, in denen die finanzökonomische Welt unlesbar und undurchschaubar geworden ist: Hier wirken Ungewissheit und Instabilität im Herzen des Systems; und hier vollzieht sich ein Angriff der Zukunft auf die übrige Zeit - das Gespenst des Kapitals.},

With its brilliant explanation of how some sectors of the economy require a blend of market, regulation, and social outlay, and a new preface addressing the current global economic crisis, Kuttner's study will play an important role in policy-making for the twenty-first century".

In this highly anticipated volume, Cohen draws on his work in these diverse topics to develop an argument about what he calls, following John Rawls, 'democracy's public reason'. He rejects the conventional idea that democratic politics is simply a contest for power, and that philosophical argument is disconnected from life. Political philosophy, he insists, is part of politics, and its job is to contribute to the public reasoning about what we ought to do. At the heart of Cohen's normative vision for our political life is an ideal of democracy in which citizens and their representatives deliberate about the requirements of justice and the common good. It is an idealistic picture, but also firmly grounded in the debates and struggles in which Cohen has been engaged over nearly three decades. "Philosophy, Politics, Democracy" explores these debates and considers their implications for the practice of democratic politics.},

As global governance is increasingly driven by market fundamentalism, growing numbers of citizens have become socially excluded and internally stateless. Against this movement to organize society exclusively by market principles, Margaret Somers argues that socially inclusive democratic rights must be counter-balanced by the powers of a social state, a robust public sphere and a relationally-sturdy civil society. Through epistemologies of history and naturalism, contested narratives of social capital, and Hurricane Katrina's racial apartheid, she warns that the growing authority of the market is distorting the non-contractualism of citizenship; rights, inclusion and moral worth are increasingly dependent on contractual market value. In this pathbreaking work, Somers advances an innovative view of rights as public goods rooted in an alliance of public power, political membership, and social practices of equal moral recognition - the right to have rights.},

  shorttitle = {The Rhetoric of Reaction},
  abstract = {With engaging wit and subtle irony, Albert Hirschman maps the diffuse and treacherous world of reactionary rhetoric in which conservative public figures, thinkers, and polemicists have been arguing against progressive agendas and reforms for the past two hundred years. Hirschman draws his examples from three successive waves of reactive thought that arose in response to the liberal ideas of the French Revolution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man, to democratization and the drive toward universal suffrage in the nineteenth century, and to the welfare state in our own century. In each case he identifies three principal arguments invariably used: (1) the perversity thesis, whereby any action to improve some feature of the political, social, or economic order is alleged to result in the exact opposite of what was intended; (2) the futility thesis, which predicts that attempts at social transformation will produce no effects whatever--will simply be incapable of making a dent in the status quo; (3) the jeopardy thesis, holding that the cost of the proposed reform is unacceptable because it will endanger previous hard-won accomplishments. He illustrates these propositions by citing writers across the centuries from Alexis de Tocqueville to George Stigler, Herbert Spencer to Jay Forrester, Edmund Burke to Charles Murray. Finally, in a lightning turnabout, he shows that progressives are frequently apt to employ closely related rhetorical postures, which are as biased as their reactionary counterparts. For those who aspire to the genuine dialogue that characterizes a truly democratic society, Hirschman points out that both types of rhetoric function, in effect, as contraptions designed to make debate impossible. In the process, his book makes an original contribution to democratic thought. The Rhetoric of Reaction is a delightful handbook for all discussions of public affairs, the welfare state, and the history of social, economic, and political thought, whether conducted by ordinary citizens or academics.},

Leading, as well as lesser known figures in the fields of writing, theory and criticism contribute to this inspiring body of work that includes sections on Nationalism, Hybridity, Diaspora and Globalization. The Reader's wide-ranging approach reflects the remarkable diversity of work in the discipline along with the vibrancy of anti-imperialist writing both within and without the metropolitan centres. Covering more debates, topics and critics than any comparable book in its field, The Postcolonial Studies Reader is the ideal starting point for students and issues a potent challenge to the ways in which we think and write about literature and culture.},

Drawing on critical theory, he outlines an alternative program for the organization of political institutions advocating a form of communicatively rational democracy, which he terms discursive democracy, that stresses the importance of active citizenship and public discourse. He draws out the limitations of instrumental rationality and investigates how policy analysis and political science may be reformed to help constitute and comprehend democracy. Discursive Democracy examines how the political process can be made more vital and meaningful. At the same time it shows how such an invigorated process will serve as a more effective agent for social problem solving.},

  abstract = {Ökonomische Renten: Dies sind Erträge, denen keine Kosten gegenüberstehen - wenigstens einzelwirtschaftlich. Allerdings gibt es nichts umsonst. Irgendjemand wird immer belastet, und sei es durch Verzichtskosten. Das Muster: Gut organisierte Gruppen streichen die ökonomischen Renten ein, die Kosten werden auf schwach organisierte Gruppen abgewälzt. Unsere Eigentumsordnung leistet dem Vorschub. Sie differenziert nicht zwischen Eigentum, das auf Leistung gründet und solchem, das ursächlich auf Usurpation beruht. Die "Erbsünde" ist das Privateigentum an Land und die daraus fließenden Renten. Land stellt die Blaupause für die "Einfriedung" weiterer Allmenden dar, deren Inwertsetzung aber zu Lasten der Allgemeinheit geschieht. Die Entkopplung von Nutzen und Kosten in der Rentenökonomie wäre daher nicht ohne die Entkopplung von Leistung und Gegenleistung im Steuerstaat möglich. So wird z.B. Infrastruktur öffentlich finanziert, die ökonomischen Renten hieraus werden aber privatisiert. Entkoppelt man aber einerseits in der Rentenökonomie Nutzen und Kosten, droht hier Marktversagen; entkoppelt man andererseits im Steuerstaat Einnahmen und Ausgaben, ist die Folge dort Staatsversagen. Nötig ist daher eine Politik, die konsequent und gegen den Widerstand von Interessengruppen die Reziprozität von privaten Nutzen und Kosten sowie staatlichen Einnahmen und Ausgaben herstellt.},

This illuminating book will be of great interest to all those in many disciplines who use decision theory and game theory to study human behavior and thought. Skyrms begins by discussing the Bayesian theory of individual rational decision and the classical theory of games, which at first glance seem antithetical in the criteria used for determining action. In his effort to show how methods for dealing with information feedback can be productively combined, the author skillfully leads us through the mazes of equilibrium selection, the Nash equilibria for normal and extensive forms, structural stability, causal decision theory, dynamic probability, the revision of beliefs, and, finally, good habits for decision. The author provides many clarifying illustrations and a handy appendix called Deliberational Dynamics on Your Personal Computer. His powerful model has important implications for understanding the rational origins of convention and the social contract, the logic of nuclear deterrence, the theory of good habits, and the varied strategies of political and economic behavior.},

  abstract = {This is at once an account and an explanation of the evolution of European states during the present millennium. The central problem addressed by the author concerns the great variety in the kinds of state that have prevailed in Europe since AD 990. Professor Tilly shows how interactions between the wielders of power on the one hand and the manipulators of capital on the other resulted in three state formations each of which prevailed over long periods - tribute-taking empires, systems of fragmented sovereignty, and national states. He argues that to conceive European state development as a simple, unilinear process is untenable, and further that relations between the states themselves are a big factor in their formation and evolution. The final part of the book then applies these insights to the history of Third World states since 1945. For the paperback edition the author has made minor revisions throughout and provided an additional section on the rapid changes that have recently taken place in Central and Eastern Europe.

How is liberal society to interpret the diversity of morals? Is pluralism the appropriate response? How does pluralism differ from the widely condemned relativism -- more specifically, the double bind of ethnocentric universalism, or `liberalism for the Liberals, cannibalism for the cannibals.'Taking as his starting point Robert Frost's accusation that a liberal is someone who can't take his own side in an argument, Steven Lukes confronts liberal thought with its own limitations. While recognizing the dangers of moral imperialism, Lukes argues that a relativist position based on identifying clearly distinct cultural and moral communities is incoherent. Drawing on work in anthropology and philosophy, he examines the nature of social justice, the politics of identity and human rights theory, as well as discussing how ideas drawn from the work of Isaiah Berlin can shed light on these debates.},

Its second is to use the examples of the world's five largest industrialized nations (France, Germany, the UK, Japan, and the US) to empirically demonstrate how the elites of a given country, above all the political and economic elites, are recruited and how they cooperate with one another.},

Genau in der Mitte kommt es zur Konfrontation, treffen die beiden Erzähler, Amnon Zichroni und Jan Wechsler, aufeinander. Amnon Zichroni besitzt die Fähigkeit, Erinnerungen anderer Menschen nachzuerleben. Geboren in Jerusalem und streng jüdisch erzogen, studiert er in den USA und lässt sich in Zürich als Analytiker nieder. Dort begegnet er dem Geigenbauer Minsky, den er ermuntert, seine traumatische Kindheit in einem NS-Vernichtungslager schreibend zu verarbeiten. Beider Existenz steht auf dem Spiel, als der Journalist Jan Wechsler behauptet, das Minsky-Buch sei reine Fiktion ... Zehn Jahre später wird eben diesem Jan Wechsler ein Koffer zugestellt, der ihm bei einer Reise nach Israel verloren gegangen sein soll - doch Wechsler kann sich an den Koffer nicht erinnern. Auf den Spuren fragwürdig gewordener Erinnerungen reist er nach Israel und gerät in ein Verhör. Tatsächlich, stellt sich heraus, ist er schon einmal dort gewesen, und sein damaliger Gastgeber, Amnon Zichroni, gilt seither als vermisst ... Ein faszinierender, spannender Roman über die Unzuverlässigkeit unserer Erinnerungen und das Ringen um Identität.},

Denn das Leben ist kein Glücksspiel, sondern folgt ganz bestimmten Gesetzmäßigkeiten. So ist es auch kein Zufall, wenn wir immer wieder an die „Falschen`` geraten, denn sie sind die Richtigen, die wir unbewusst angezogen haben. Der bekannte Autor und Psychologe Hermann Meyer hält seinen Lesern so treffend den Spiegel vor, dass die eigenen problematischen Anziehungsmechanismen, Denk- und Verhaltensfehler, die zum „Frust in der Liebe`` führen, offensichtlich werden. Wer sich darauf einlässt, lernt, den Partner anzuziehen, den er sich wünscht. -- Dieser Text bezieht sich auf eine andere Ausgabe: Taschenbuch .},

  shorttitle = {Weibliche Domination},
  abstract = {Was ist weibliche Domination? Der gesamte Begriff scheint im Gegensatz zu unserer von Männern dominierten Gesellschaft zu stehen. Doch weibliche Domination, auch FemDom genannt, stammt nicht etwa von dominanten Frauen oder Feministinnen Männer haben diesen Begriff geprägt, um damit ihr sexuelles und soziales Bedürfnis nach Unterwerfung unter das weibliche Geschlecht auszudrücken! Ist weibliche Domination also eine sexuelle Phantasie, die in manchen Männern schlummert, oder spiegelt sich darin die aktuelle gesellschaftliche Entwicklung wider? Die amerikanische Psychologin und Soziologin Elise Sutton untersucht in diesem Buch das männliche Urbedürfnis, von einer Frau dominiert zu werden. Sie untersucht den männlichen Wunsch nach Unterwerfung unter das Weibliche aus psychologischer Perspektive und erforscht den Ursprung dieses Bedürfnisses sowie die Frage, wie diese häufig vorkommende männliche Phantasie sich in der Gesellschaft immer weiter ausbreitet: Frauen werden immer freier und unabhängiger. Elise Sutton vergleicht die weibliche Domination mit einem großen Haus, das unter seinem Dach viele Formen, Ausprägungen und Lifestyles beherbergt. Die Autorin nimmt den Leser mit in die persönliche und intime Lebensgeschichte von 40 Paaren, die seine eigenen Verwandten, Kollegen oder Freunde sein könnten. Sie alle praktizieren verschiedene Varianten der weiblichen Domination. Einige Paare mögen es soft und sinnlich, andere hart und streng, wieder andere wild und aufregend; einige mögen es romantisch, andere hingegen eher bizarr; einige praktizieren diesen Lifestyle vor allem im Schlafzimmer, andere sowohl innerhalb als auch außerhalb ihres Schlafzimmers. Die Erfahrungsberichte dieser Paare zeigen auf, wie die weibliche Domination ein Band der Intimität knüpfen, Streit schlichten und Stress mindern kann; Sex spielt sich dadurch auf einem höheren Level als nur dem körperlichen ab, der gesellschaftliche Status der Frau steigt und sogar gewöhnliche Hausarbeiten erhalten durch die weibliche Domination den entscheidenden Schuss sexuelle Spannung. Elise Sutton beschreibt, wie die weibliche Domination das Kind im Manne befriedigen, das weibliche Selbstbewusstsein stärken, mehr Leidenschaft ins Schlafzimmer bringen, die Romantik wiederaufleben lassen und einen Machtaustausch innerhalb der Beziehung bewirken kann. Sie stellt fest, dass unsere Gesellschaft sich langsam, aber unaufhaltsam in Richtung einer Frauengesellschaft wandelt.},

Sie sind auf eine für das individuelle Alltagsleben und die Funktionsweise des Wirtschaftssystems insgesamt riskante, nicht immer effiziente und schon gar nicht stabile, aber meistens ertragreiche Weise verkoppelt. Arbeit wird über Geld gesteuert. Wenn die Geldkommunikation unterbrochen wird, ruht die Arbeit. Dabei wird das, was Geld heißt, in einem weitgehend selbstbezüglichen Innovationsprozeß immer wieder neu sozial konstruiert. In Auseinandersetzung mit einschlägigen soziologischen und ökonomischen Theorien werden in diesem Buch diejenigen sozialen Prozesse analysiert, die sowohl den Geldgebrauch ermöglichen als auch im Zusammenspiel von Geld und Arbeit die Selbststeuerungs-, Selbststimulierungs- und Selbstlähmungsfähigkeiten des modernen Wirtschaftssystems freisetzen.

Part I includes chapters surveying the key research methodologies employed in comparative politics (the comparative method; the use of history; the practice and status of case-study research; the contributions of field research) and assessing the possibility of constructing a science of comparative politics. Parts II to IV examine the foundations of political order: the origins of states and the extent to which they relate to war and to economic development; the sources of compliance or political obligation among citizens; democratic transitions, the role of civic culture; authoritarianism; revolutions; civil wars and contentious politics. Parts V and VI explore the mobilization, representation and coordination of political demands. Part V considers why parties emerge, the forms they take and the ways in which voters choose parties. It then includes chapters on collective action, social movements and political participation. Part VI opens up with essays on the mechanisms through which political demands are aggregated and coordinated. This sets the agenda to the systematic exploration of the workings and effects of particular institutions: electoral systems, federalism, legislative-executive relationships, the judiciary and bureaucracy. Finally, Part VII is organized around the burgeoning literature on macropolitical economy of the last two decades.},

Doch gibt es ein weiteres marktapologetisches Rechtfertigungsmuster, welches dem Generaleinwand gegenüber dem reinen Ökonomismus, eine Ethik ohne Moral zu repräsentieren, nicht unterliegt: Diese Position lässt sich als „Neoliberalismus`` fassen. Dieser setzt, statt am Vorteilstausch, am Epiphänomen des Wettbewerbs an. Die Pflicht, die er uns auferlegt, ist dabei eine einzige: für wettbewerbliche Verhältnisse zu sorgen. Denn der Wettbewerb neutralisiere Macht, beseitige Diskriminierung und sorge für einen wachsenden Wohlstand für alle, wozu „Chancengleichheit`` herzustellen sei. Überdies werden ihm - als einem „Entdeckungsverfahren`` - normative Erkenntnisfunktionen zugesprochen. Die Arbeit fußt auf den Grundannahmen einer integrativ verstandenen Wirtschaftsethik, die die bislang in der Regel bloß implizite Normativität ökonomischer Theorien kritisch klären will. Dabei wird nicht nur eine basale, dem Anspruch nach klarere Theorie des Wettbewerbs entwickelt (die eher an den Austrians als am Mainstream anknüpft), sondern auch der Wettbewerb als untaugliches Konzept der Gerechtigkeit erwiesen. Auch eine Marktapologetik qua Wettbewerbsapologetik scheitert. Der Wettbewerb taugt nicht zum Prinzip des ethisch Richtigen. Die Frage nach dem Wettbewerb ist vielmehr eine Frage des Maßes. Dieses Maß zu bestimmen ist Aufgabe demokratischer Politik. Dieser will die Arbeit Orientierung bieten.},

Therborn uses the formal categories of modern system analysis -- input mechanisms, processes of transformation, output flows -- to advance a substantive Marxist analysis of state power and state apparatuses. His account of these is comparative in the most far-reaching historical sense: its object is nothing less than the construction of systematic typology of the differences between the feudal state, the capitalist state and the socialist state. Therborn ranges from the monarchies of mediaeval Europe through the bourgeois democracies of the west in the 20th century to the contemporary regimes in Russia, Eastern Europe and China. The book ends with a major analytic survey of the strategies of working class parties for socialism, from the Second International to the Comintern to Eurocommunism, that applies the structural findings of Therborn's enquiry in the `Future as History'. Written with lucidity and economy, What Does the Ruling Class Do when it Rules? represents a remarkable sociological and political synthesis.},

He brings to his analysis a number of abstract models of political and economic structure, and illustrates the issues in the context of historical events, tracing the development of socialist strategies since the mid-nineteenth century. Several of the conclusions are novel and provocative. Professor Przeworski argues that economic issues cannot justify a socialist programme, and that the workers had good reasons to struggle for the improvement of capitalism. Therefore, the project of a socialist transformation, and the fight for economic advancement, were separate historical phenomena.},

  shorttitle = {Critical Theories of the State},
  abstract = {Critical Theories of the State is a clear and accessible survey of radical perspectives on the modern state. By focusing on Marxist theory and its variations, particularly as applied to advanced industrial societies and contemporary welfare states, Clyde W. Barrow provides a more extensive and thorough treatment than is available in any other work. Barrow divides the methodological assumptions and key hypotheses of Marxist, Neo-Marxist, and Post-Marxist theories into five distinct approaches: instrumentalist, structuralist, derivationist, systems-analytic, and organizational realist. He categorizes the many theorists discussed in the book, including such thinkers as Elmer Altvater, G. William Domhoff, Fred Block, Claus Offe, and Theda Skocpol according to their concepts of the state's relationship to capital and their methodological approach to the state. Based on this survey, Barrow elaborates a compelling typology of radical state theories that identifies with remarkable clarity crucial points of overlap and divergence among the various theories. Scholars conducting research within the rubric of state theory, political development, and policy history will find Critical Theories of the State an immensely valuable review of the literature. Moreover, Barrow's work will make an excellent textbook for undergraduate and graduate courses in political science and sociology, and can also be used by those teaching theory courses in international relations, history, and political economy.},

  shorttitle = {The Race Card},
  abstract = {Did George Bush's use of the Willie Horton story during the1988 presidential campaign communicate most effectively when no one noticed its racial meaning? Do politicians routinely evoke racial stereotypes, fears, and resentments without voters' awareness? This controversial, rigorously researched book argues that they do. Tali Mendelberg examines how and when politicians play the race card and then manage to plausibly deny doing so. In the age of equality, politicians cannot prime race with impunity due to a norm of racial equality that prohibits racist speech. Yet incentives to appeal to white voters remain strong. As a result, politicians often resort to more subtle uses of race to win elections. Mendelberg documents the development of this implicit communication across time and measures its impact on society.Drawing on a wide variety of research - including simulated television news experiments, national surveys, a comprehensive content analysis of campaign coverage, and historical inquiry - she analyzes the causes, dynamics, and consequences of racially loaded political communication. She also identifies similarities and differences among communication about race, gender, and sexual orientation in the United States and between communication about race in the United States and ethnicity in Europe, thereby contributing to a more general theory of politics. Mendelberg's conclusion is that politicians - including many current state governors - continue to play the race card, using terms like "welfare" and "crime" to manipulate white voters' sentiments without overtly violating egalitarian norms. But she offers some good news: implicitly racial messages lose their appeal, even among their target audience, when their content is exposed.},

To effectively acquire the tools and techniques they need to interpret multivariate data, social science students need clear explanations, a minimum of mathematical detail, and a wide range of exercises and worked examples. Classroom tested for more than 10 years, "The Analysis and Interpretation of Multivariate Data for Social Scientists" describes and illustrates methods of multivariate data analysis important to the social sciences.The authors focus on interpreting the pattern of relationships among many variables rather than establishing causal linkages, and rely heavily on numerical examples, visualization, and on verbal, rather than mathematical exposition. They present methods for categorical variables alongside the more familiar method for continuous variables and place particular emphasis on latent variable techniques. Ideal for introductory, senior undergraduate and graduate-level courses in multivariate analysis for social science students, this book combines depth of understanding and insight with the practical details of how to carry out and interpret multivariate analyses on real data. It gives them a solid understanding of the most commonly used multivariate methods and the knowledge and tools to implement them.},

  abstract = {Hayek gives the main arguments for the free-market case and presents his manifesto on the "errors of socialism." Hayek argues that socialism has, from its origins, been mistaken on factual, and even on logical, grounds and that its repeated failures in the many different practical applications of socialist ideas that this century has witnessed were the direct outcome of these errors. He labels as the "fatal conceit" the idea that "man is able to shape the world around him according to his wishes." "The achievement of The Fatal Conceit is that it freshly shows why socialism must be refuted rather than merely dismissed\&\#8212;then refutes it again."\&\#8212;David R. Henderson, Fortune. "Fascinating. . . . The energy and precision with which Mr. Hayek sweeps away his opposition is impressive."\&\#8212;Edward H. Crane, Wall Street Journal F. A. Hayek is considered a pioneer in monetary theory, the preeminent proponent of the libertarian philosophy, and the ideological mentor of the Reagan and Thatcher "revolutions."},

We ask whether it is meaningful to include young children as participants in this kind of research, and if Q methodology using visual images is a suitable research method that may give reliable and valid results. An example is given through a study of 20 children aged five. The conclusion is that this may be a suitable approach, and that there are indications that the results are both reliable and valid. However, more research is needed to explore the usefulness of Q methodology with visual images in studies of very young children.},

This study proposes an analytic framework that combines ``welfare regime'' and gender‐specific policies to explain country differences. The findings presented here suggest that institutional arrangements mediate the costs to women's part‐time and intermittent employment. Within welfare regimes, employment continuity is highest among countries in which the state provides support for working mothers. Furthermore, this study finds that lower support for mothers' employment is associated with higher wage penalties to employment discontinuity.},

  abstract = {Crime and welfare are now widely viewed as "coded" issues that activate white Americans' negative views of blacks without explicitly raising the "race card." But does the desire of whites to combat crime or curtail welfare really stem from their dislike of blacks? Are these not pressing problems about which Americans rightly should be concerned--apart from any associations these issues may have with race? In this paper I assess the extent to which white Americans' opposition to welfare is rooted in their attitudes toward blacks. Using conventional survey modeling techniques and a randomized survey-based experiment from a national telephone survey, I find that racial attitudes are the single most important influence on whites' welfare views. I also show that whites hold similar views of comparably described black and white welfare mothers, but that negative views of black welfare mothers are more politically potent, generating greater opposition to welfare than comparable views of white welfare mothers.},

  abstract = {Debates on how to reduce poverty and inequality have focused on two controversial questions: Should social policies be targeted to low-income groups or be universal? Should benefits be equal for all or earnings-related? Traditional arguments in favor of targeting and flat-rate benefits, focusing on the distribution of the money actually transferred, neglect three policy-relevant considerations: (1) The size of redistributive budgets is not fixed but reflects the structure of welfare state institutions. (2) A trade-off exists between the degree of low-income targeting and the size of redistributive budgets. (3) Outcomes of market-based distribution are often more unequal than those of earnings-related social insurance programs. We argue that social insurance institutions are of central importance for redistributive outcomes. Using new data, our comparative analyses of the effects of different institutional types of welfare states on poverty and inequality indicate that institutional differences lead to unexpected outcomes and generate the paradox of redistribution: The more we target benefits at the poor and the more concerned we are with creating equality via equal public transfers to all, the less likely we are to reduce poverty and inequality.},

These findings -- based on the long-term historical experience of the OECD's oldest federations -- suggest that federal arrangements tend to slow down welfare state consolidation, but that much depends on the context of historical development. The emergence of bypass mechanisms circumventing federal veto-points is located as the key to welfare progress, and the role of regulation in European integration and the special role of the ECJ as well as that of `the open method of co-ordination' are tentatively identified as possible EU bypass equivalents.},

It identifies a set of specific distributional trade-offs associated with the new role played by the services sector as the chief source of employment growth in advanced democracies over the last three decades. It is argued that three core policy objectives-budgetary restraint, wage equality, and expansion of employment-constitute a political "trilemma" that allows only two of the goals to be successfully pursued at the same time. Using a combination of statistical and case-oriented analysis, the authors demonstrate the political and economic salience of the trilemma, the distributional tensions inherent in each strategy to cope with it, and the political-institutional constraints under which these strategies are chosen.},

  abstract = {It has long been assumed among Western commentators that rapid economic growth in East and South-east Asia has been achieved without the development of social policies. It has often been inferred that growth without social welfare is not only possible, but beneficial to further strong economic growth. The article questions these perceptions and beliefs. First, to what extent did East and South-east Asian countries delay the introduction of social insurance schemes compared to European pioneering countries, in the sense of introducing them only at a much higher level of 'modernization'? Second, to what extent was the economic miracle achieved by some of these countries based on (or accompanied by) attempts to forestall or retrench welfare state schemes? Third, to what extent has the recent financial crisis led to attempts at lowering or changing standards of social protection? The study shows that the Asian countries generally introduced social security programmes at a lower level of 'modernization' than Western European countries; that rapid and strong economic growth in the decade 1985--95 has in general been accompanied by welfare expansion; and that even after the financial crisis of 1997, expansion of state welfare responsibility is more evident than efforts to reduce or dismantle state welfare responsibility]},

Yet West European health policies have radically changed the working conditions and incomes of doctors in many countries. Why have some governments been able to 'socialize' medicine? This article seeks to refute the view that the medical profession exercises a universal veto power. In contrast to scholars who explain medical influence in terms of singular characteristics of the medical profession or through the historical process of professionalization, this essay focuses on the properties of distinct political systems that make them vulnerable to medical influence. It argues that we have veto points within political systems and not veto groups within societies. By comparing the lobbying efforts of medical associations in Switzerland, France, and Sweden, the article analyses the role of political institutions in accounting for different patterns of medical association influence on health policy.},

  abstract = {Britain was a pioneer in launching a modern welfare state. Before World War I, it instituted workers' compensation, old age pensions, health insurance, and the world's first compulsory system of unemployment insurance. By the end of the nineteenth century, the United States had expanded Civil War pensions into de facto old age and disability pensions for many working- and middle-class Americans. However, during the Progressive Era, as the Civil War generation died off, the United States failed to institute modern pensions and social insurance. Conventional theories of welfare-state development-theories emphasizing industrialization, liberal values, and demands by the organized industrial working class-cannot sufficiently account for these contrasting British and U.S. patterns. Instead, a macropolitical explanation is developed. By the early twentieth century, Britain had a strong civil service and competing, programmatically oriented political parties. Patronage politics had been overcome, and political leaders and social elites were willing to use social spending as a way to appeal to working-class voters. However, the contemporary United States lacked an established civil bureaucracy and was embroiled in the efforts of Progressive reformers to create regulatory agencies and policies free of the "political corruption" of nineteenth-century patronage democracy. Modern social-spending programs were neither governmentally feasible nor politically acceptable at this juncture in U.S. political history.},

  abstract = {Pelkmans ndash; European Integration: Methods and Economic Analysis, Third edition'The bible of European economic integration studies.' Professor Hiromasa Kubo, President of the EU Institute, Kobe University, Japan'This text is very well researched and the author displays an excellent knowledge of the EU both at an institutional level and at an economic analysis level.'Dr Adrian Gourlay, Loughborough University Written by one of Europe's leading EU economic analysts, this third edition of European Integration has been significantly reorganised in structure, fully revised, and updated to reflect the changes in the European Union over recent years.The book offers a fundamental discussion and detailed analysis of European integration. Uniquely, it combines economic analysis with a detailed knowledge of the integration methods employed in the EU. Whilst being academically rigorous and assuming some prior knowledge, it is full of practical examples and case studies, enabling students to bridge the gap between theory and policy practice. Key features Unique integration of economic theory with EU regulatory and policy framework. Non-mathematical treatment of economic theory - which is presented using graphical, non-algebraic tools. Innovative analysis of the economics of subsidiarity, EU regulation, the economic constitution of the Union, services market integration and the EU budget. Numerous case studies and practical examples included throughout. New to the third edition Fully updated - now including a more extensive economic analysis of monetary union, the euro, and monetary and fiscal policy in the eurozone. Updated coverage of the economic and strategic issues of enlargement in the EU-25, soon to be EU-27, and beyond. New chapters on 'The Economics of EU Regulation' and 'Assessing the EU Budget'. Revised and extended treatment of economic cohesion (convergence and divergence) and EU social policy and reforms. Updated coverage of the internal market for network industries and the Bolkestein directive on horizontal liberalisation of services, plus a deeper economic analysis of pro-competitive effects of the single market. Includes new examples on recent issues, and cases that have been revised and deepened analytically. AudienceEuropean Integration is an intermediate level text which has been carefully designed to appeal to a wide range of students studying economic integration as part of an economics, business, law or public administration degree.AuthorJacques Pelkmans is Jan Tinbergen Chair for European Economics and Director of the Department of European Economic Studies at the College of Europe in Bruges. He is also a Council Member of the WRR in The Hague (an independent think-tank, attached to the Prime Minister's office) and Associate Fellow of the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) in Brussels.},

Ces groupes locaux, politiquement autonomes, non seulement font la guerre, mais peuvent aussi former des alliances contre des ennemis communs. La théorie des jeux permet de décrire les interactions entre groupes locaux dans des sociétés sans Etat, dont la guerre et les alliances sont des éléments constituants.},

  title = {Heterogeneity in the Relationship between Income and Happiness: {{A}} Conceptual-Referent-Theory Explanation},
  volume = {28},
  abstract = {This paper puts forward a new explanation to the general finding of a weak relationship between income and happiness; which is based oil the conceptual-referent theory of happiness (CRT). CRT studies what conceptual referent for happiness a person has in mind when making a judgment about tier happiness. The theory states that the subjective evaluation of life as a whole is influenced by a person's notion of what a happy life is. The theory stresses the importance of heterogeneity; this is: the conceptual referent is not the same for everybody. The paper shows that heterogeneity in the conceptual referent also extends to the relationship between happiness and income. Income is an important explanatory variable for some people, while for others it is completely irrelevant; and this depends on the conceptual referent for happiness a person holds. The existence of heterogeneity in the conceptual referent for happiness and, consequently, in the explanatory structure of happiness has important implications for behavioural economics. Happiness pursuing persons are expected to behave differently if they have different notions of what a happy life is. The empirical analysis is based on a large database from Mexico.

  abstract = {International research on the social determinants of health has increasingly started to integrate a welfare state regimes perspective. Although this is to be welcomed, to date there has been an over-reliance on Esping-Andersen's The three worlds of welfare capitalism typology (1990). This is despite the fact that it has been subjected to extensive criticism and that there are in fact a number of competing welfare state typologies within the comparative social policy literature. The purpose of this paper is to provide public health researchers with an up-to-date overview of the welfare state regime literature so that it can be reflected more accurately in future research. It outlines The three worlds of welfare capitalism typology, and it presents the criticisms it received and an overview of alternative welfare state typologies. It concludes by suggesting new avenues of study in public health that could be explored by drawing upon this broader welfare state regimes literature.},

  title = {Individualism-{{Collectivism}} - {{Critique}} and {{Proposed Refinements}}},
  volume = {21},
  abstract = {Presents 3 criticisms of the individualism-collectivism dichotomy (ICD) in cross-cultural psychology research. First, the ICD leads one to overlook values that serve both individual and collective interests. The ICD also ignores values that foster the goals of collectivities other than the ingroup. Finally, the ICD promotes the mistaken assumption that individualistic and collective values each form coherent syndromes that are in polar opposition. These problems are illustrated by applying a theory of universal value types to data from studies by M. Rokeach (1973), D. A. Ellerman et al (unpublished manuscript), H. C. Triandis et al (see record 1988-25273-001), and A. Uutela (1988). The analysis supported the criticisms and revealed group differences that are obscured by the ICD. Hypotheses are offered about the types of values likely to discriminate between societies with collectivist vs individualistic social structures.

  abstract = {Income inequality is widely assumed to be a major contributor to poorer health at national and subnational levels. According to this assumption, the most appropriate policy strategy to improve equity in health is income redistribution. This paper considers reasons why tackling income inequality alone could be an inadequate approach to reducing differences in health across social classes and other population subgroups, and makes the case that universal social programs are critical to reducing inequities in health. A health system oriented around a strong primary care base is an example of such a strategy.},

  abstract = {Maslow's hierarchy-of-needs theory is used to predict development of Quality of Life (QOL) in countries over time. Previous data sets have not had sufficient power to test these development trends among countries. Therefore a new database was developed that includes annual quality of life time-series for 88 countries from 1960 to 1994, covering measures on all five of Maslow's need-levels. Results showed significant agreement with some of Maslow's predictions, including his sequence of need achievement, and parts of an S-shaped trajectory in QOL. However, his mechanism of growth - that countries must slow growth in one area to increase growth in another - was disconfirmed.},

  abstract = {Presents a theory of potentially universal aspects in the content of human values. 10 types of values (power, achievement, hedonism, stimulation, self-direction, universalism, benevolence, tradition, conformity, and security) are distinguished by their motivational goals. The theory also postulates a structure of relations among the value types, based on the conflicts and compatibilities experienced when pursuing them. This structure permits one to relate systems of value priorities, as an integrated whole, to other variables. A new values instrument, based on the theory, is described. Evidence from 25,863 schoolteachers, university students, adults, and adolescents in 44 countries is summarized. Relations of this approach to M. Rokeach's (1973) work on values and to other theories and research on value dimensions are discussed. Application of the approach to social issues is exemplified in politics and intergroup relations.

@article{WelzelInglehart-2003-aa,
  title = {The Theory of Human Development: {{A}} Cross-Cultural Analysis},
  volume = {42},
  abstract = {Abstract. This article demonstrates that socioeconomic development, emancipative cultural change and democratization constitute a coherent syndrome of social progress - a syndrome whose common focus has not been properly specified by classical modernization theory. We specify this syndrome as 'human development', arguing that its three components have a common focus on broadening human choice. Socioeconomic development gives people the objective means of choice by increasing individual resources; rising emancipative values strengthen people's subjective orientation towards choice; and democratization provides legal guarantees of choice by institutionalizing freedom rights. Analysis of data from the World Values Surveys demonstrates that the linkage between individual resources, emancipative values and freedom rights is universal in its presence across nations, regions and cultural zones; that this human development syndrome is shaped by a causal effect of individual resources and emancipative values on freedom rights; and that this effect operates through its impact on elite integrity, as the factor which makes freedom rights effective.

  abstract = {This article considers the relevance of time theory for Beck's theory of reflexive modernization and vice versa. It focuses in particular on discontinuity in the context of continuity, on decontextualization, naturalization and responsibility as key concerns of both perspectives on the industrial way of life. It makes explicit the temporal underpinnings of that cultural form with respect to five Cs: the creation of time to human design (C1), the commodification of time (C2), the compression of time (C3), the control of time (C4,) and the colonization of time (C5). It concludes that explicit concern with temporal relations shows reflexive modernization in action and facilitates improved knowledge for deliberative change. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Neu in diesem Beitrag ist die explizite Bezugnahme auf den Begriff der Bürgergesellschaft, die er prononciert als emanzipatorische Aufgabe sieht.... In didaktischer Hinsicht plädiert er für eine Konzentration auf epochaltypische Schlüsselprobleme von gesamtgesellschaftlicher, zukunftsweisender und zumeist auch weltumspannender Bedeutung. Im einzelnen benennt er: Die Umweltfrage, das Wachstum der Weltbevölkerung, die gesellschaftlich verursachte Ungleichheit, die Frage von Krieg und Frieden, die Frage nach Sinn und Problematik des Nationalitätsprinzips, die Gefahren und Möglichkeiten der neuen technischen Steuerungs-, Informations- und Kommunikationsmedien sowie schließ lich das Problem der Subjektivität des Einzelnen. Zur Bewältigung dieser Schlüsselprobleme bedarf es in der Bürgergesellschaft bestimmter Schlüsselqualifikationen ... : Kritikbereitschaft und -fähigkeit, Argumentationbereitschaft und -fähigkeit, Empathie, Kooperationsbereitschaft und -fähigkeit, Kreativität sowie vernetzendes Denken. Sie erfordern wiederum unterrichtsorganisatorische und allgemeindidaktische Konsequenzen.},

  title = {The {{Age}} of {{Empathy}}},
  isbn = {0-307-40777-2},
  abstract = {``An important and timely message about the biological roots of human kindness.''---Desmond Morris, author of The Naked ApeAre we our brothers' keepers? Do we have an instinct for compassion? Or are we, as is often assumed, only on earth to serve our own survival and interests? In this thought-provoking book, the acclaimed author of Our Inner Ape examines how empathy comes naturally to a great variety of animals, including humans. By studying social behaviors in animals, such as bonding, the herd instinct, the forming of trusting alliances, expressions of consolation, and conflict resolution, Frans de Waal demonstrates that animals--and humans--are ``preprogrammed to reach out.'' He has found that chimpanzees care for mates that are wounded by leopards, elephants offer ``reassuring rumbles'' to youngsters in distress, and dolphins support sick companions near the water's surface to prevent them from drowning. From day one humans have innate sensitivities to faces, bodies, and voices; we've been designed to feel for one another.De Waal's theory runs counter to the assumption that humans are inherently selfish, which can be seen in the fields of politics, law, and finance, and whichseems to be evidenced by the current greed-driven stock market collapse. But he cites the public's outrage at the U.S. government's lack of empathy in the wake of Hurricane Katrina as a significant shift in perspective--one that helped Barack Obama become elected and ushered in what may well become an Age of Empathy. Through a better understanding of empathy's survival value in evolution, de Waal suggests, we can work together toward a more just society based on a more generous and accurate view of human nature.Written in layman's prose with a wealth of anecdotes, wry humor, and incisive intelligence, The Age of Empathy is essential reading for our embattled times.From the Hardcover edition.},

  abstract = {Suppose Congress were to change Social Security just before you retired? Or repeal income tax deductions for homeowners? Or institute a flat tax? Should those changes be retroactive? Or should you retain the gains or accept the losses resulting from the new enactments? What kinds of policies might governments adopt in order to mitigate the transitional effects of changing legal rules? Daniel Shaviro tackles these tough questions, bringing legal, economic, and political perspectives to bear on a persistent problem not often given serious attention. When Rules Change: An Economic and Political Analysis of Transition Relief and Retroactivity focuses on tax law changes to develop an in-depth understanding of the transitional issues inherent in any substantive rule change and also to advance a set of normative policy guidelines applicable to any such circumstance. Shaviro reframes traditional approaches to the problem of retroactivity and offers new insights into both the theory and policy of legislative transitions.},

In this approach, participants are primed to develop an ?appreciative gaze? by focusing the discussion on what already works well in the system and imagining possibilities for building on these strengths. It is distinguished from contestatatory approaches in that argumentative, blame-seeking and deficit-oriented forms of discourse are considered counter-productive to the process. We argue against a one-sided emphasis on appreciative inquiry, which must be balanced with more contestatory forms.

  title = {Toward a {{Sociology}} of {{Deliberation}}},
  volume = {3},
  abstract = {This essay draws insights from Pierre Bourdieus field theory for the development of a so- ciological theory of deliberation. Most work on deliberative practice is strongly shaped by the concerns of deliberative democratic theory, and that theory tends to approach deliberation as a procedural mechanism for decision-making. Thus, there has been very little effort to theorize the sociological dimensions of deliberative practice. Bourdieus theory highlights a crucial dilemma in that practice. Efforts to infuse community politics with deliberation represent a politics of the most fundamental kind: a struggle to redefine the preferred categories, rules, roles, values, and behaviors that structure public life. But deliberation itself does not constitute a cohesive field of social activity. There is no common sense definition of what deliberation is, or how to tell a good deliberator from a bad one; moreover, as yet one can achieve no social distinction or status from embracing deliberation. Thus, members of a community engage in a fundamental political struggle without a shared sense of what they are doing or why they are doing it, and without the rewards of status or distinction that come with participation in an ongoing social field. Illustrated with examples from two years of ethnographic fieldwork into the practice of deliberation, this theory shows deliberation to be a fluid, sociologically complex and politically charged exercise.},

  abstract = {This paper examines self-reported health among individuals in 21 European countries. The purpose is to analyze how both individual- and country-level characteristics influence health. The study is based on data from the European Social Survey (ESS) conducted in 2003 and employs hierarchical modelling (N=38,472). We present three main findings: (1) individual-level characteristics, such as age, education, economic satisfaction, social network, unemployment, and occupational status are related to the health of individuals, both for women and men; (2) we tested how societal features, such as public expenditure on health, socioeconomic development, lifestyle, and social capital (social trust) were related to subjective health. Among the country-level characteristics, socioeconomic development, measured as GDP per capita (logarithm), is the indicator that is most strongly associated with better health, after controlling for individual-level characteristics; (3) the eastern European countries stand out as the countries where individuals report the poorest health. In our models, the individual-level variables explain 60\% of the variance between countries, whereas 40\% is explained by the macro-level variables.},

  abstract = {A new middle class has emerged, composed of persons who have achieved affluence and secure status in occupations oriented to intellectual and cultural work. Families in this stratum rear children with values and character structures which are at some variance with the dominant culture. Such youth are especially sensitized to social questions, are repelled by acquisitive and nationalistic values, and strive for a vocational situation which maximizes autonomy and self-expression. This sector of the youth population has been the primary constituency for the American student movement of the 1960's. Although the situation of these youth differs from that found in other countries with significant student movements, there are important resemblances between the two. A comparative analysis of student movements suggests that their emergence is a precursor of major qualitative societal and cultural change.},

  title = {The Cosmopolitan Perspective: Sociology of the Second Age of Modernity},
  volume = {51},
  abstract = {'Second age of modernity' is a magical password that is meant to open the doors to new conceptual landscapes. The whole world of nation sovereignty is fading away - including the 'container theory of society' on which most of the sociology of the first age of modernity is based upon. In this article I propose a distinction between 'simple globalization' and 'reflexive cosmopolitization'. In the paradigm of the first age of modernity, simple globalization is interpreted within the territorial compass of state and politics, society and culture. This involves an additive, not substitutive, conception of globalization as indicated for example by 'interconnectedness'. In the paradigm of the second age of modernity globalization changes not only the relations between and beyond national states and societies, but also the inner quality of the social and political itself which is indicated by more or less reflexive cosmopolitization as an institutionalized learning process - and its enemies.

In this fMRI, study individuals played a specially designed computer game, according to a set of predefined rules, either in cooperation with or in competition against another person. The hemodynamic response during these conditions was contrasted to that of the same subjects playing the game independently. Both cooperation and competition stances resulted in activation of a common frontoparietal network subserving executive functions, as well as the anterior insula, involved in autonomic arousal. Moreover, distinct regions were found to be selectively associated with cooperation and competition, notably the orbitofrontal cortex in the former and the inferior parietal and medial prefrontal cortices in the latter. This pattern reflects the different mental frameworks implicated in being cooperative versus competitive with another person. In accordance with evidence from evolutionary psychology as well as from developmental psychology, we argue that cooperation is a socially rewarding process and is associated with specific left medial orbitofrontal cortex involvement.},

I develop a theory of the dynamics of protest waves by comparing data on protests in West Germany between 1965 and 1989 with similar data from the Netherlands, Italy, and the United States. Striking similarities are noted among these different protest waves in the development of action repertoires, levels of repression and facilitation, and the involvement of different types of organizations. An explanation for these dynamic patterns combines external and internal factors: The interplay between facilitation, repression, and the chance of success defines a set of external constraints that combine with activists' choices among three strategic options--innovation, increased participation, or increased militancy.},

  title = {Adminstration {{Problems}} of an {{Expenditure Tax}}},
  abstract = {An expenditure tax has been endorsed at various times by a respectable number of most notable scholars such as Thomas Hobbes, John Revans, John Stuart Mill, Eduard Pfeiffer, Alfred Marshall, Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, Arthur Cecil Pigou, Irving Fisher, Luigi Einaudi, Joseph A. Schumpeter, Nicholas Kaldor, and James Edward Meade, to name only the most prominent ones. Over the years several motions have been proposed to enact an expenditure tax, or to consider it for possible enactment. Such proposals include John Stuart Mill's famous suggestion to the Select Committee on Income and Property Tax in 18611, the considerations of the Colwyn Committee on National Debt and Taxation2, Congressman Ogden L. Mills' motion of a spending tax bill put before the U.S. House of Representatives in 19213, Mr. Morgenthau's proposal of an expenditure tax to pay for the war submitted to the Finance Committee of the Senate of the United States in September 19424, the suggestion of an expenditure tax by the Danish Commission on Tax Reform in 19585 and by the Swedish Government Commission on Taxation in 19726, by the British Meade Committee in (1978), the Blueprints of the U.S. Treasury (1977/1984), the Information Report of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (1974), and - let us not forget --- the discussions within the Royal Commission on the Taxation of Profits and Income, appointed in 19507, which provided much of the material leading to Kaldor's well-known book published in 1955. None of these numerous attempts at establishing an expenditure tax was ever adopted, save for rather short interludes of expenditure tax enactment in India and Sri Lanka8.},

This article critiques the conceptual foundation of Veenhoven's paper, and examines technical deficiencies in his review of evidence. Based on previous findings and new analyses, we conclude that happiness has both traitlike and statelike properties, but that individual differences in happiness endure despite its situational reactivity, and explain greater variance than situational effects.},

  title = {Measuring {{Inequality}} of {{Happiness}} in {{Nations}}: {{In Search}} for {{Proper Statistics}}},
  volume = {6},
  abstract = {Comparative research on happiness typically focuses on the level of happiness in nations, which is measured using the mean. There have also been attempts to compare inequality of happiness in nations and this is measured using the standard deviation. There is doubt about the appropriateness of that latter statistic and some prefer to use the statistics currently used to compare income inequality in nations, in particular the Gini coefficient. In this paper, we review the descriptive statistics that can be used to quantify inequality of happiness in nations. This review involves five steps: (1) we consider how happiness nations is assessed, (2) next we list the statistics of dispersion and considered their underlying assumptions; (3) we construct hypothetical distributions that cover our notion of inequality; (4) we define criteria of performance and (5) we check how well the step-2 statistics meet the step-4 demands when applied to the step-3 hypothetical distributions. We then applied the best performing statistics to real distributions of happiness in nations. Of the nine statistics considered, five failed this empirical test. One of the failed statistics is the Gini coefficient. Its malfunction was foreseen on theoretical grounds: the Gini coefficient assumes a ratio level of measurement, while happiness measures can at best be treated at the interval level. The Gini coefficient has been designed for application to 'capacity' variables such as income rather than to 'intensity' variables such as happiness. Four statistics proved to be satisfactory; these were (1) the standard deviation, (2) the mean absolute difference, (3) the mean pair difference and (4) the interquartile range. Since all four, statistics performed about equally well, there is no reason to discontinue the use of the standard deviation when quantifying inequality of happiness in nations.

  title = {The {{Relationship Between Income}} and {{Subjective Well}}-{{Being}} - {{Relative}} or {{Absolute}}},
  volume = {28},
  abstract = {Although it appears that income and subjective well-being correlate in within-country studies (Diener, 1984), a debate has focused on whether this relationship is relative (Easterlin, 1974) or absolute (Veenhoven, 1988, 1991). The absolute argument advanced by Veenhoven states that income helps individuals meet certain universal needs and therefore that income, at least at lower levels, is a cause of subjective well-being. The relativity argument is based on the idea that the impact of income or other resources depends on changeable standards such as those derived from expectancies, habituation levels, and social comparisons. Two studies which empirically examine these positions are presented: one based on 18 032 college studies in 39 countries, and one based on 10 year longitudinal data in a probability sample of 4 942 American adults. Modest but significant correlations were found in the U.S. between income and well-being, but the cross-country correlations were larger. No evidence for the influence of relative standards on income was found: (1) Income change did not produce effects beyond the effect of income level per se, (2) African-Americans and the poorly educated did not derive greater happiness from specific levels of income, (3) Income produced the same levels of happiness in poorer and richer areas of the U.S., and (4) Affluence correlated with subjective well-being both across countries and within the U.S. Income appeared to produce lesser increases in subjective well-being at higher income levels in the U.S., but this pattern was not evident across countries. Conceptual and empirical questions about the universal needs position are noted. Suggestions for further explorations of the relativistic position are offered.},

  volume = {45},
  abstract = {Despite major differences, prevailing approaches in democratization research have one thing in common: they downplay the role of mass attitudes. This article criticizes the neglect of mass attitudes, arguing that it ignores the very essence of democratization. In light of human development theory, democratization is essentially an emancipative process, for it manifests human freedom by empowering people with civil and political rights. From this premise, the author concludes that democratization should be driven by emancipative forces in the population and that these forces are reflected in particular mass attitudes: liberty aspirations. Based on evidence from the Values Surveys, the analyses show that more widespread liberty aspirations facilitate progress and impede regress in the process of democratization. No other indicator - including GDP/capita and social capital - outperforms the effect of liberty aspirations on democratization. The article concludes that human development theory is useful because its emphasis on people empowerment highlights something that has been ignored in the democratization literature: emancipative motivational forces in the population.

  abstract = {A theory of the types of values on which cultures can be compared is presented and validated with data from 49 nations from around the world. Seven types of values are identified, structured along three polar dimensions: Conservatism versus Intellectual and Affective Autonomy; Hierarchy versus Egalitarianism; and Mastery versus Harmony. Based on their cultural value priorities, nations are arrayed in a two-dimensional space, revealing meaningful groupings of culturally related nations. Analyses replicate with both urban teachers of grades 3-12 and college student samples. Implications of national differences in cultural values for differences in meaning of work are explicated. To stimulate research on cultural values and work, hypotheses are developed regarding the cultural value emphases that are especially compatible or conflicting with work centrality, with different societal norms about work, and with the pursuit of four types of work values or goals.

  title = {Social {{Capital}} and {{Democracy}}: An {{Interdependent Relationship}}},
  volume = {67},
  abstract = {Current democratic theory and recent international policy initiatives reveal an intense interest in the relationship between social capital and democracy. This interest is the most recent variant of a long theoretical tradition positing that a vigorous associational life is beneficial for the creation and maintenance of democracy. Despite the popularity of this view, little quantitative empirical evidence exists to support the relationship. Here, the relationship between social capital and democracy is tested using data from a large, quantitative, cross-national study. Two additional tests are introduced. First, the plausible reciprocal effect--from democracy to social capital--is included in models. Second, the potentially negative impact of some associations on democracy is considered. Using data from the World Values Survey and the Union of International Associations in a cross-lagged panel design, results show that social capital affects democracy and that democracy affects social capital. Additional tests demonstrate that associations that are connected to the larger community have a positive effect on democracy, while isolated associations have a negative effect. Theory relating social capital to democracy is drawn from the literature on civil society, political culture, and social movements. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Social Mobility in Europe is the most comprehensive study to date of trends in intergenerational social mobility. It uses data from 11 European countries covering the last 30 years of the twentieth century to analyze differences between countries and changes through time. The findings call into question several long-standing views about social mobility. We find a growing similarity between countries in their class structures and rates of absolute mobility: in other words, the countries of Europe are now more alike in their flows between class origins and destinations than they were thirty years ago. However, differences between countries in social fluidity (that is, the relative chances, between people of different class origins, of being found in given class destinations) show no reduction and so there is no evidence supporting theories of modernization which predict such convergence. Our results also contradict the long-standing Featherman Jones Hauser hypothesis of a basic similarity in social fluidity in all industrial societies 'with a market economy and a nuclear family system'. There are considerable differences between countries like Israel and Sweden, where societal openness is very marked, and Italy, France, and Germany, where social fluidity rates are low. Similarly, there is a substantial difference between, for example, the Netherlands in the 1970s (which was quite closed) and in the 1990s, when it ranks among the most open societies. Mobility tables reflect many underlying processes and this makes it difficult to explain mobility and fluidity or to provide policy prescriptions. Nevertheless, those countries in which fluidity increased over the last decades of the twentieth century had not only succeeded in reducing class inequalities in educational attainment but had also restricted the degree to which, among people with the same level of education, class background affected their chances of gaining access to better class destinations.},

  title = {The {{Four Qualities}} of {{Life}}},
  volume = {1},
  abstract = {The terms 'quality-of-life', 'well-being' and 'happiness' denote different meanings; sometimes they are used as an umbrella term for all of value, and at other times to denote special merits. This paper is about the specific meanings of the terms. It proposes a classification based on two bi-partitions; between life 'chances' and life 'results', and between 'outer' and 'inner' qualities. Together these dichotomies imply four qualities of life: 1) livability of the environment, 2) life-ability of the individual, 3) external utility of life and 4) inner appreciation of life. This fourfold matrix is applied in three ways: firstly to place related notions and alternative classifications, secondly to explore substantive meanings in various measures for quality of life and thirdly to find out whether quality-of-life can be measured comprehensively. This last question is answered in the negative. Current sum-scores make little sense. The most inclusive measure is still how long and happily people live. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Fresh data sources on cross-national income are examined to document recent changes in the composition of world income inequality within and between nations. New evidence shows that during the 1980s and 1990s the composition of world income inequality experienced a fundamental change, characterized by the diminishing significance of between-nation income differences and the growing prominence of within-nation inequalities. Two competing trends account for this change: (1) steady growth in the average level of income inequality within nations, and (2) a decline in income inequality between nations. These recent trends signify a reversal in one of the major legacies of the Industrial Revolution--the internationalization of world income inequality across national borders. The findings raise important questions for future studies of cross-national inequality and development. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@book{Fujita1999,
  title = {The Spatial Economy: {{Cities}}, Regions, and International Trade},
  abstract = {Explores how a common approach that emphasizes the three-way interaction among increasing returns, transportation costs, and the movement of productive factors can be applied to a wide variety of issues in regional, urban, and international economics. Introduces the basic approach in the context of ``regional'' models in which ``agriculture'' is the primary sector and is immobile across locations but ``manufacturing'' is a sector that is subject to increasing returns and can move between regions and discusses the Dixit-Stiglitz model of monopolistic competition and its spatial implications; how interactions among increasing returns at the level of the firm, transport, costs, and factor mobility can cause spatial economic structure to emerge and change; the case of multiregional economics; and the consequences of costly agricultural transport. Considers the location of cities in a world in which everything is mobile, examining a heuristic approach to the spatial modeling of urban systems; the monocentric economy; the emergence of new cities; the evolution of a hierarchical urban system; the size of cities; and how variations in the natural landscape, such as ports and rivers, can influence urban location. Explores international trade, discussing international specialization; economic development and the spread of industry; industrial clustering; the emergence of regions of specialization in a borderless world with continuous space; and the possible interaction between international trade and the process of urbanization within nations. Fujita is at the Kyoto Institute of Economic Research, Kyoto University. Krugman is at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Venables is at the London School of Economics. Index.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.08.036},
  abstract = {Whether or not the scale of a society's income inequality is a determinant of population health is still regarded as a controversial issue. We decided to review the evidence and see if we could find a consistent interpretation of both the positive and negative findings. We identified 168 analyses in 155 papers reporting research findings on the association between income distribution and population health, and classified them according to how far their findings supported the hypothesis that greater income differences are associated with lower standards of population health. Analyses in which all adjusted associations between greater income equality and higher standards of population health were statistically significant and positive were classified as ``wholly supportive''; if none were significant and positive they were classified as ``unsupportive''; and if some but not all were significant and supportive they were classified as ``partially supportive''. Of those classified as either wholly supportive or unsupportive, a large majority (70 per cent) suggest that health is less good in societies where income differences are bigger. There were substantial differences in the proportion of supportive findings according to whether inequality was measured in large or small areas. We suggest that the studies of income inequality are more supportive in large areas because in that context income inequality serves as a measure of the scale of social stratification, or how hierarchical a society is. We suggest three explanations for the unsupportive findings reported by a minority of studies. First, many studies measured inequality in areas too small to reflect the scale of social class differences in a society; second, a number of studies controlled for factors which, rather than being genuine confounders, are likely either to mediate between class and health or to be other reflections of the scale of social stratification; and third, the international relationship was temporarily lost (in all but the youngest age groups) during the decade from the mid-1980s when income differences were widening particularly rapidly in a number of countries. We finish by discussing possible objections to our interpretation of the findings.},

  title = {Universals in the Content and Structure of Values: {{Theoretical}} Advances and Empirical Tests in 20 Countries},
  abstract = {(from the chapter) Four basic issues are addressed in this research: What are the substantive contents of human values? Can we identify a comprehensive set of values? To what extent is the meaning of particular values equivalent for different groups of people? How are the relations among different values structured? First, this chapter identifies 10 motivationally distinct value types that are likely to be recognized within and across cultures and used to form value priorities. Second, the author demonstrates that this set of value types is relatively comprehensive, encompassing virtually all the types of values to which individuals attribute at least moderate importance as criteria of evaluation. Third, evidence from 20 countries is assembled showing that the meaning of the value types and of most of the single values that constitute them is reasonable equivalent across most groups. Finally, the author discovers two basic dimensions that organizes value systems into an integrated motivational structure with consistent value conflicts and compatibilities.

  abstract = {This article critically analyzes the popular television show, Ally McBeal, with a specific focus on how women and ethnic minorities are stereotypically portrayed. Through Complicity Theory, Standpoint Feminist, and Womanism, this article contends that the mediated representations of women and ethnic minorities on Ally McBeal are largely negative, and that stereotypical images of these groups continue to be perpetuated in the media. In an effort to interrogate and problematize these mediated images; that is, what is ''womanhood'' and who are ''ethnic minorities,'' a move from complicity to implicature theory is offered.

@book{Schlicht1998,
  title = {On {{Custom}} in the {{Economy}}},
  isbn = {0-19-829224-4},
  abstract = {The aim of this book is to re-establish custom in economics. Current economic theorizing largely neglects the customary forces that underpin market exchange. Economic sociologists have stressed this repeatedly by referring to the 'embeddedness' of all kinds of economic processes. It is true that market processes do hinge on elements of custom, but custom is in turn moulded by economic processes. This other causal direction needs more attention than it has hitherto received. The waymodern institutional economics has developed points to the same deficiency. Institutional economics initially tried to analyse economic institutions as arising from market processes and competition whilst avoiding reference to all elements of custom, but it became increasingly clear that answersobtained in this fashion were critically dependent on tacit underlying assumptions about the customary infrastructure.Another current strand of thought, notably originating with game theory, has tried to understand the emergence of customs by viewing them as routines that have been adopted because of their success. This approach views customs essentially as conventions that solve coordination problems. It is driven by the economic paradigm that interprets behaviour as fully reducible to the interplay of (given) preferences and constraints whilst neglecting the direct motivational impact of custom. The secondaim of the book is thus to systematically harmonize the motivational significance of custom with institutional theorizing. The re-establishment of custom in economics will provide foundations for institutional economics which reduce the arbitrariness of current thinking.},

  abstract = {What is more important: to provide citizens with more money or with more autonomy for their subjective well-being? In the current meta-analysis, the authors examined national levels of well-being on the basis of lack of psychological health, anxiety, and stress measures. Data are available for 63 countries, with a total sample of 420,599 individuals. Using a 3-level variance-known model, the authors found that individualism was a consistently better predictor than wealth, after controlling for measurement, sample, and temporal variations. Despite some emerging nonlinear trends and interactions between wealth and individualism, the overall pattern strongly suggests that greater individualism is consistently associated with more well-being. Wealth may influence well-being only via its effect on individualism. Implications of the findings for well-being research and applications are outlined.},

  abstract = {A common thread weaving through the current public participation debate is the need for new approaches that emphasize two-way interaction between decision makers and the public as well as deliberation among participants. Increasingly complex decision making processes require a more informed citizenry that has weighed the evidence on the issue, discussed and debated potential decision options and arrived at a mutually agreed upon decision or at least one by which all parties can abide. We explore the recent fascination with deliberative methods for public involvement first by examining their origins within democratic theory, and then by focusing on the experiences with deliberative methods within the health sector. In doing so, we answer the following questions ``What are deliberative methods and why have they become so popular? What are their potential contributions to the health sector?'' We use this critical review of the literature as the basis for developing general principles that can be used to guide the design and evaluation of public involvement processes for the health-care sector in particular.},

These reference group processes distort perceptions of class: They make most people think they are middle class, thereby weakening the link between objective class and subjective perceptions of class and class conflict, fostering consensual rather than conflictual views of class relations, and attenuating the links between class and politics, particularly in Central European nations.

  title = {Associations and {{Democracy}} - {{Between Theories}}, {{Hopes}}, and {{Realities}}},
  volume = {29},
  abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been a resurgence of interest and research into the connections between associations and democracy. This article divides the question of associative contributions to democracy into four component parts: What (a) contributions do (b) different kinds of associations make to advance (c) contesting ideals of democratic governance in various (d ) political contexts? Associations enhance democracy in at least six ways: through the intrinsic value of associative life, fostering civic virtues and teaching political skills, offering resistance to power and checking government, improving the quality and equality of representation, facilitating public deliberation, and creating opportunities for citizens and groups to participate directly in governance. These contributions are not all mutually consonant with one another, and different forms of associations are better suited to advance some contributions than others. Furthermore, those who propose bolstering associations as a strategy for revitalizing democracy frequently have quite different ideals of democracy in mind. The forms and contributions of associations appropriate to three contesting notions of democratic governance--liberal minimalism, conventional representation-cum-administration, and participatory democracy--are also discussed. Finally, the democratic priority of associative contributions depends crucially on contextual features of particular societies. Under tyrannical regimes, for example, associations that resist government authority are more crucial than those that foster compliance and respect for political institutions.

  abstract = {A longitudinal study predicted changes in burnout or engagement a year later by identifying 2 types of early indicators at the initial assessment. Organizational employees (N = 466) completed measures of burnout and 6 areas of worklife at 2 times with a 1-year interval. Those people who showed an inconsistent pattern at Time 1 were more likely to change over the year than were those who did not. Among this group, those who also displayed a workplace incongruity in the area of fairness moved to burnout at Time 2, while those without this incongruity moved toward engagement. The implications of these 2 predictive indicators are discussed in terms of the enhanced ability to customize interventions for targeted groups within the workplace.},

  isbn = {0-06-000569-6},
  abstract = {In the spirit of Alvin Toffler's Future Shock, a social critique of our obsession with choice, and how it contributes to anxiety, dissatisfaction and regret. This paperback includes a new P.S. section with author interviews, insights, features, suggested readings, and more. Whether we're buying a pair of jeans, ordering a cup of coffee, selecting a long-distance carrier, applying to college, choosing a doctor, or setting up a 401(k), everyday decisions--both big and small--have become increasingly complex due to the overwhelming abundance of choice with which we are presented.We assume that more choice means better options and greater satisfaction. But beware of excessive choice: choice overload can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them, it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations, and it can make you blame yourself for any and all failures. In the long run, this can lead to decision-making paralysis, anxiety, and perpetual stress. And, in a culture that tells us that there is no excuse for falling short of perfection when your options are limitless, too much choice can lead to clinical depression.In The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz explains at what point choice--the hallmark of individual freedom and self-determination that we so cherish--becomes detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz shows how the dramatic explosion in choice--from the mundane to the profound challenges of balancing career, family, and individual needs--has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution. Schwartz also shows how our obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse.By synthesizing current research in the social sciences, Schwartz makes the counterintuitive case that eliminating choices can greatly reduce the stress, anxiety, and busyness of our lives. He offers eleven practical steps on how to limit choices to a manageable number, have the discipline to focus on the important ones and ignore the rest, and ultimately derive greater satisfaction from the choices you have to make.},

@article{Sirgy-1998-aa,
  title = {Materialism and Quality of Life},
  volume = {43},
  abstract = {An attempt is made in this paper to establish a foundation for a theory of materialism and quality of life. The theory posits that overall life satisfaction (quality of life) is partly determined by satisfaction with standard of living. Satisfaction with standard of living, in turn, is determined by evaluations of one's actual standard of living compared to a set goal. Materialists experience greater dissatisfaction with their standard of living than nonmaterialists, which in turn spills over to overall life causing dissatisfaction with life in general. Materialists experience dissatisfaction with their standard of living because they set standard of living goals that are inflated and unrealistically high. These goals set by materialists are more influenced by affective-based expectations (such as ideal, deserved, and need-based expectations) than cognitive-based ones (such as predictive, past, and ability based expectations). Materialists' ideal standard-of-living expectations are influenced by social comparisons involving remote referents, more so than comparisons involving standards that are situationally imposed. Examples of situationally-imposed standards are perceptions of wealth, income, and material possessions of family, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and so on. In contrast, examples of standards based on remote sources are perceptions of standard of living of others in one's community, town, state, country, other countries; perceptions of standard of living of others based on gender, age, education, ethnicity, occupation, and social class. This tendency to use remote referents in social comparisons may account for materialists' inflated and value-laden expectations of their standard of living. Materialists' deserved standard-of-living expectations are influenced by the tendency to engage in equity comparisons involving income and work. Thus, materialists compare themselves with others that seem to have more income and worked no harder. These equity comparisons generate feelings of inequity, injustice, anger, or envy. These emotions may also account for materialists' inflated and value-laden expectations of their standard of living. Materialists' standard-of-living expectations based on minimum needs are influenced by the tendency to spend more than generate income. This proclivity to overconsume and underproduce may be partly responsible for materialists' inflated and value-laden expectations of their standard of living.},

First, I present a basic overview of neuroanatomy and explain how brain activity is measured. I then survey findings from the neuroeconomics literature on acquiring rewards and avoiding losses, learning, choice under risk and ambiguity, delay of gratification, the role of emotions in decision-making, strategic decisions and social decisions. I conclude by identifying new directions that neuroeconomics is taking, including applications to public policy and law.},

  title = {The {{Market Transition Debate}}: {{Toward}} a {{Synthesis}}?},
  volume = {101},
  abstract = {The article focuses on the theory of market transition. In his article on market transition, researcher Victor Nee offered a new theory of social inequality and applied it to the study of the problem of transition from state socialist redistributive economy to market capitalism. Nee claimed that the emergence of markets in state socialist redistributive economies had unexpected consequences. The most privileged stratum or class of state socialism, redistributors, lost some of their privilege, while those at the bottom of the state socialist hierarchy, the ''direct producers,'' benefited. As a result, inequality, as measured by income or access to scarce goods, was reduced. Nee's theory identified the mechanisms by which markets generated equality under redistributive systems: if wages are not administratively set, but established by transactive relations, then producers are likely to have more power; if markets operate, then human capital is likely to be rewarded more while political loyalty is likely to matter less; if there are markets in a redistributive economy, then entrepreneurship becomes an alternative avenue of socio-economic mobility. Data collected in 1985 in rural China offered support to the theory of market transition.},

  volume = {6},
  abstract = {It is said that inequality is returning to modern nations and that this is manifest in the widening disparities in income in the late 20th century. This trend is attributed to neo-liberalism, globalisation and immigration, and is seen as a turn in the long-term trend towards a more civilised society. In this paper I challenge the idea of rising inequality. I argue that income difference falls short as an indicator of inequality and cannot be meaningfully compared across time. Instead I propose to measure inequality in another way, not by difference in presumed chances for a good life, but by the dispersion of actual outcomes of life, using the standard deviation of life-satisfaction as an indicator. Comparison across time in EU nations over the years 1973-2001 shows that the dispersion of life-satisfaction became smaller instead of larger. Comparison across 80 nations in the 1990s also shows lower dispersion in the most modern countries. So the trend towards greater equality seems to persist. If there is any truth in the theory that access to scarce resources has become more unequal, the tendency must have been compensated in some way, possibly by greater equality in personal capabilities.

  title = {Global {{Governance}} as a {{Perspective}} on {{World Politics}}},
  volume = {12},
  abstract = {In one of the first issues of Global Governance, Larry Finkelstein observed that ''Global Governance' appears to be virtually anything'. A decade later, the concept of global governance has become ever more popular--and confusion about its meaning ever greater. While we do think that some flexibility in the use of concepts is both theoretically desirable and practically unavoidable, we believe that the current disarray is a hindrance to more fruitful discussions and to the goal of developing more coherent theories of global governance. We therefore argue that a more careful use of the term global governance is necessary to overcome the current confusion spawned by the variation in uses of the concept. After clarifying the basic function of concepts in social science and reviewing the different uses of global governance in the current literature, we use the term as an analytical concept that provides a perspective on world politics different from the more traditional notion of 'international relations'.

  abstract = {We demonstrate by mathematical analysis and systematic computer simulations that redistribution can lead to sustainable growth in a society. In accordance with economic models of risky human capital, we assume that dynamics of human capital is modeled as a multiplicative stochastic process which, in the long run, leads to the destruction of individual human capital. When agents are linked by fully redistributive taxation the situation might turn to individual growth in the long run. We consider that a government collects a proportion of income and reduces it by a fraction as costs for administration (efficiency losses). The remaining public good is equally redistributed to all agents. Sustainable growth is induced by redistribution despite the losses from the random growth process and despite administrative costs. Growth results from a portfolio effect. The findings are verified for three different tax schemes: proportional tax, taking proportionally more from the rich, and proportionally more from the poor. We discuss which of these tax schemes performs better with respect to maximize growth under a fixed rate of administrative costs, and the governmental income. This leads us to general conclusions about governmental decisions, the relation to public good games with free riding, and the function of taxation in a risk-taking society.},

  abstract = {The article discusses the aspect of social inequality and stratification theory in an attempt to show the relationship between stratification and the rest of the social order. Starting from the proposition that no society is ''classless,'' or unstratified, an effort is made to explain, in functional terms, the universal necessity which calls forth stratification in any social system. Next, an attempt is made to explain the roughly uniform distribution of prestige and income as between the major types of positions in every society. Two questions are of importance in this context; how certain individuals get into their relative positions, and why different positions and social groups carry different degrees of prestige, particularly with regard to the ease or difficulty of mobility between strata. The first question is logically prior and important. The answer is that a competitive system often gives greater importance to the motivation to achieve positions, whereas a non-competitive system gives perhaps greater importance to the motivation to perform duties of positions.},

  volume = {43},
  abstract = {This article demonstrates that low corruption and high female representation are two characteristics of elite quality that go closely together and help make ''formal'' democracy increasingly ''effective.'' However, the quality of elites is not an inherently independent phenomenon but is shaped by a pervasive mass factor: rising self-expression values that shift cultural norms toward greater emphasis on responsive and inclusive elites. Self-expression values, in turn, tend to be strengthened by growing human resources among the masses. Considered in a comprehensive perspective, these various components are linked through the emancipative logic of Human Development: (1) human resources, (2) self-expression values, (3) elite quality, and (4) effective democracy all contribute to widen the scope of human autonomy and choice in several aspects of people's lives, including their means and skills, their norms and values, as well as their institutions and rights.

  abstract = {Human beings exhibit substantial interpersonal trust-even with strangers. The neuroactive hormone oxytocin facilitates social recognition in animals, and we examine if oxytocin is related to trustworthiness between humans. This paper reports the results of an experiment to test this hypothesis, where trust and trustworthiness are measured using the sequential anonymous ``trust game'' with monetary payoffs. We find that oxytocin levels are higher in subjects who receive a monetary transfer that reflects an intention of trust relative to an unintentional monetary transfer of the same amount. In addition, higher oxytocin levels are associated with trustworthy behavior (the reciprocation of trust). Absent intentionality, both the oxytocin and behavioral responses are extinguished. We conclude that perceptions of intentions of trust affect levels of circulating oxytocin.},

@book{Fischer1996a,
  title = {Inequality by Design: Cracking the Bell Curve Myth},
  isbn = {0-691-02899-0},
  abstract = {As debate rages over the widening and destructive gap between the rich and the rest of Americans, Claude Fischer and his colleagues present a comprehensive new treatment of inequality in America. They challenge arguments that expanding inequality is the natural, perhaps necessary, accompaniment of economic growth. They refute the claims of the incendiary bestseller The Bell Curve (1994) through a clear, rigorous re-analysis of the very data its authors, Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, used to contend that inherited differences in intelligence explain inequality. Inequality by Design offers a powerful alternative explanation, stressing that economic fortune depends more on social circumstances than on IQ, which is itself a product of society. More critical yet, patterns of inequality must be explained by looking beyond the attributes of individuals to the structure of society. Social policies set the ``rules of the game'' within which individual abilities and efforts matter. And recent policies have, on the whole, widened the gap between the rich and the rest of Americans since the 1970s.Not only does the wealth of individuals' parents shape their chances for a good life, so do national policies ranging from labor laws to investments in education to tax deductions. The authors explore the ways that America--the most economically unequal society in the industrialized world--unevenly distributes rewards through regulation of the market, taxes, and government spending. It attacks the myth that inequality fosters economic growth, that reducing economic inequality requires enormous welfare expenditures, and that there is little we can do to alter the extent of inequality. It also attacks the injurious myth of innate racial inequality, presenting powerful evidence that racial differences in achievement are the consequences, not the causes, of social inequality. By refusing to blame inequality on an unchangeable human nature and an inexorable market--an excuse that leads to resignation and passivity--Inequality by Design shows how we can advance policies that widen opportunity for all.},

  title = {Democracy without {{Democratic Values}}: {{A Rejoinder}} to {{Welzel}} and {{Inglehart}}},
  volume = {41},
  abstract = {In reply to Welzel and Inglehart in this issue, we deploy three lines of criticism. First, we argue that their newly invented construct ''effective democracy'' is conceptually and empirically flawed. Second, we show that their results are highly sensitive to model specification. Regardless of the time period, their supportive evidence vanishes if a more pertinent measure of democracy is used instead of measures based on the absence of corruption, if a broader index of socioeconomic modernization is controlled for, and if their compound index of emancipative values is replaced by its core component: liberty aspirations. Third, we find that emancipative values are not a coherent syndrome at the individual level within countries, rendering the causal mechanism linking these values to democracy through collective action unintelligible. We conclude that democratic values are not a robust determinant of democratization. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Over the life cycle, however, aspirations grow along with income, and undercut the favourable effect of income growth on happiness, although the cross-sectional happiness-income difference persists. People think they were less happy in the past and will be happier in the future, because they project current aspirations to be the same throughout the life cycle, while income grows. But since aspirations actually grow along with income, experienced happiness is systematically different from projected happiness. Consequently, choices turn out to be based on false expectations.},

  title = {Economics as a {{Social Science}} - {{An Approach}} to {{Nonautistic Theory}}},
  isbn = {0-472-11243-0},
  abstract = {Economics as a Social Science is a highly readable critique of economic theory, based on a wide range of research, that endeavors to restore economics to its proper role as a social science. Contrary to conventional economic theory, which assumes that people have no free will, this book instead bases economics on the realistic assumption that human beings can choose; that we are complex beings affected by emotion, custom, habit, and reason; and that our behavior varies with circumstances and times. It embraces the findings of history, psychology, and other social sciences and the insights from great literature on human behavior as opposed to the rigidity set by mathematical axioms that define how economics is understood and practiced today.Andrew M. Kamarck demonstrates that only rough accuracy is attainable in economic measurement, and that understanding an economy requires knowledge from other disciplines. The canonical hypotheses of economics (perfect rationality, self-interest, equilibrium) are shown to be inadequate (and in the case of ``equilibrium'' to be counterproductive to understanding the forces that dominate the economy), and more satisfactory assumptions provided. The market is shown to work imperfectly and to require appropriate institutions to perform its function reasonably well. Further, Kamarck argues that self-interest does not always lead to helping the general interest.Economics as a Social Science examines and revises the fundamental assumptions of economics. Because it avoids jargon and explains terms carefully, it will be of interest to economics majors as well as to graduate students of economics and other social sciences, and social scientists working in government and the private sector.Andrew M. Kamarck is former Director, Economic Development Institute, the World Bank.},

This disagreement is linked to politics and social structure, with older, high SES, politically conservative respondents preferring markedly higher pay for elite occupations, but usually not preferring lower pay for ordinary jobs.

When you can eat just about anything nature (or the supermarket) has to offer, deciding what you should eat will inevitably stir anxiety, especially when some of the foods might shorten your life. Today, buffeted by one food fad after another, America is suffering from a national eating disorder. As the cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast food outlet confronts us with a bewildering and treacherous landscape, what's at stake becomes not only our own and our children's health, but the health of the environment that sustains life on earth. Pollan follows each of the food chains--industrial food, organic or alternative food, and food we forage ourselves--from the source to the final meal, always emphasizing our coevolutionary relationship with the handful of plant and animal species we depend on. The surprising answers Pollan offers have profound political, economic, psychological, and even moral implications for all of us.--From publisher description},

  title = {Is Life Getting Better? {{How}} Long and Happily Do People Live in Modern Society?},
  volume = {10},
  abstract = {Human society has changed greatly,over the past centuries and this process of ''modernization'' has profoundly affected the lives of individuals; currently we live quite different lives from those our forefathers lived only five generations ago. There are differences of opinion as to whether we live better now than before and consequently there is also disagreement as to whether we should continue modernizing or rather try to slow the process down. Quality of life in a society can be measured by how long and happy its inhabitants live. Using these indicators I assessed whether societal modernization has made life better or worse. First, I examined some findings from present day survey research. Istarted with a cross-sectional analysis of 90 nations and found that people live longer and happier in today's most modern societies. Second, I examined trends in 10 modern nations over the lst 30 years and found that happiness and longevity have increased in most cases. Third, I considered the long-term and review findings from historical and comparative anthropology, which show that we lived better in the early hunter-gatherer society than in the later agrarian society. Together these data suggest that societal evolution has worked out differently for me quality of human life, first negatively, in thechange from a hunter-gatherer existence to agriculture, and next positively, in the more recent transformation from an agrarian to an industrial society. We live now longer and happier than ever},

  abstract = {Deliberative democrats are committed both to inclusion and to barring coercion in public discourse. Their commitment to democratic inclusion should make them sympathetic to the challenges faced by social movements. An adequate sociology of contentious public discourse, however, shows that social movements must often act coercively in order to be included. For example, they must often alter the terrain of conflict, create a crisis, pressure interlocutors to argue consistently, or compel other parties to enter social arenas of contention that they have avoided. Democratic theorists who are committed to inclusion should approve of such coercion. Under the actual circumstances movements face, there is a tension between non-coercion and democratic inclusion. This tension demonstrates the need for a democratic standard and a mode of democratic social analysis beyond those that deliberative theory offers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  title = {Globalization and the {{Great U}}-{{Turn}}: {{Income Inequality Trends}} in 16 {{OECD Countries}}},
  volume = {107},
  abstract = {The debate on the resurgence of income inequality in some advanced industrial societies has often focused on the impact of an increasingly integrated world economy, typified by growing capital mobility, heightened international competition, and an increase in migration. This study represents one of the first systematic, cross-national examinations of the role of globalization in the inequality ''U-turn.'' Results indicate, on the one hand, that total inequality variation is principally affected by the percentage of the labor force in agriculture, followed by the institutional factors union density and decommodification, and only then by globalization. On the other hand, longitudinal variation in inequality, while still dominated by the percentage of the labor force in agriculture, is also principally affected by aspects of globalization, such as southern import penetration and direct investment outflow, and to a lesser extent by migration. In other words, globalization explains the longitudinal trend of increasing inequality that took place within many industrial countries better than it does cross-sectional inequality differences among countries.

  doi = {10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093625},
  abstract = {Evolutionary theory postulates that altruistic behavior evolved for the return-benefits it bears the performer. For return-benefits to play a motivational role, however, they need to be experienced by the organism. Motivational analyses should restrict themselves, therefore, to the altruistic impulse and its knowable consequences. Empathy is an ideal candidate mechanism to underlie so-called directed altruism, i.e., altruism in response to anothers's pain, need, or distress. Evidence is accumulating that this mechanism is phylogenetically ancient, probably as old as mammals and birds. Perception of the emotional state of another automatically activates shared representations causing a matching emotional state in the observer. With increasing cognition, state-matching evolved into more complex forms, including concern for the other and perspective-taking. Empathy-induced altruism derives its strength from the emotional stake it offers the self in the other's welfare. The dynamics of the empathy mechanism agree with predictions from kin selection and reciprocal altruism theory.},

  volume = {77},

  abstract = {People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains. The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.},

  title = {Emancipative {{Values}} and {{Democracy}}: {{Response}} to {{Hadenius}} and {{Teorell}}},
  volume = {41},
  abstract = {This article demonstrates that Axel Hadenius and Jan Teorell's attempt to disprove a causal effect of emancipative mass orientations on democracy is flawed in each of its three lines of reasoning. First, contrary to Hadenius and Teorell's claim that measures of ''effective democracy'' end up in meaningless confusion of democracy and minor aspects of its quality, we illustrate that additional qualifications of democracy illuminate meaningful differences in the effective practice of democracy. Second, Hadenius and Teorell's finding that emancipative orientations have no significant effect on subsequent measures of democracy from Freedom House is highly unstable: using only a slightly later measure of the dependent variable, the effect turns out to be highly significant. Third, we illustrate that these authors' analytical strategy is irrelevant to the study of democratization because the temporal specification they use misses almost all cases of democratization. We present a more conclusive model of democratization, analyzing how much a country moved toward or away from democracy as the dependent variable. The model shows that emancipative orientations had a strong effect on democratization during the most massive wave of democratization ever--stronger than any indicator of economic development. Finally, we illustrate a reason why this is so: emancipative orientations motivate emancipative social movements that aim at the attainment, sustenance, and extension of democratic freedoms.

Hence the idea of elaborating an empirical test to probe the extent to which 'second modernization' is a real phenomenon, or rather, as is suggested here, a shift in our interpretation of what modernity has always been about.

  title = {Maintaining Population Health in a Period of Welfare State Decline: Political Economy as the Missing Dimension in Health Promotion Theory and Practice.},
  volume = {13},
  issn = {1025-3823},
  abstract = {There is increasing recognition in the health promotion and population health fields that the primary determinants of health lay outside the health care and behavioural risk arenas. Many of these factors involve public policy decisions made by governments that influence the distribution of income, degree of social security, and quality and availability of education, food, and housing, among others. These non-medical and non-lifestyle factors have come to be known as the social determinants of health. In many nations--and this is especially the case in North America--recent policy decisions are undermining these social determinants of health. A political economy analysis of the forces supporting as well as threatening the welfare state is offered as a means of both understanding these policy decisions and advancing the health promotion and population health agendas. The building blocks of social democracies--the political systems that seem most amenable to securing the social determinants of health--are identified as key to promoting health. Health promoters and population health researchers need to ``get political'' and recognize the importance of political and social action in support of health.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether the magnitude of income-related health inequalities varies between welfare regimes (Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, Bismarckian, Southern and Eastern). Specifically, it examined whether the Scandinavian welfare state regime has smaller income-based health inequalities than the other welfare state regimes. METHODS: The first (2002) and second (2004) waves of the representative cross-sectional European Social Survey (ESS), which comprised more than 80 000 respondents, were used to analyse income inequalities (relative health difference between the first and third income tertile) in self-reported health (general health, limiting longstanding illness) amongst those aged 25 or more. Data related to 23 European countries classified into five welfare state regimes. The study controlled for age and adjusted for educational attainment. RESULTS: When comparing the health of the first income tertile with the third, the Scandinavian countries only seemed to hold an intermediate position: they did not have the smallest, or the largest, health inequalities. However, the Anglo-Saxon welfare states had the largest income-related health inequalities for both men and women, while countries with Bismarckian welfare states tended to demonstrate the smallest. This pattern was unchanged after controlling for educational attainment. However, education seemed to explain the largest part of income-related health inequalities in the Southern regime. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the magnitudes of income-related health inequalities indeed vary by welfare state regime. However, this variation was not always in the direction expected as the Scandinavian countries did not exhibit the smallest health inequalities.},

  abstract = {Deliberative inclusive approaches, such as citizen juries, have been used to engage citizens on a range of issues in health care and public health. Researchers engaging with the public to inform policy and practice have adapted the citizen jury method in a variety of ways. The nature and impact of these adaptations has not been evaluated. We systematically searched Medline (PubMED), CINAHL and Scopus databases to identify deliberative inclusive methods, particularly citizens' juries and their adaptations, deployed in health research. Identified studies were evaluated focussing on principles associated with deliberative democracy: inclusivity, deliberation and active citizenship. We examined overall process, recruitment, evidence presentation, documentation and outputs in empirical studies, and the relationship of these elements to theoretical explications of deliberative inclusive methods. The search yielded 37 papers describing 66 citizens' juries. The review demonstrated that the citizens' jury model has been extensively adapted. Inclusivity has been operationalised with sampling strategies that aim to recruit representative juries, although these efforts have produced mixed results. Deliberation has been supported through use of steering committees and facilitators to promote fair interaction between jurors. Many juries were shorter duration than originally recommended, limiting opportunity for constructive dialogue. With respect to citizenship, few juries' rulings were considered by decision-making bodies thereby limiting transfer into policy and practice. Constraints in public policy process may preclude use of the 'ideal' citizens' jury with potential loss of an effective method for informed community engagement. Adapted citizens' jury models provide an alternative: however, this review demonstrates that special attention should be paid to recruitment, independent oversight, jury duration and moderation.},

  abstract = {The object of this study was to determine whether the magnitude of educational health inequalities varies between European countries with different welfare regimes. The data source is based on the first and second wave of the European Social Survey. The first health indicator describes people's mental and physical health in general, while the second reports cases of any limiting longstanding illness. Educational inequalities in health were measured as the difference in health between people with an average number of years of education and people whose educational years lay one standard deviation below the national average. Moreover, South European welfare regimes had the largest health inequalities, while countries with Bismarckian welfare regimes tended to demonstrate the smallest. Although the other welfare regimes ranked relatively close to each other, the Scandinavian welfare regimes were placed less favourably than the Anglo-Saxon and East European. Thus, this study shows an evident patterning of magnitudes of health inequalities according to features of European welfare regimes. Although the greater distribution of welfare benefits within the Scandinavian countries are likely to have a protective effect for disadvantaged cities in these countries, other factors such as relative deprivation and class-patterned health behaviours might be acting to widen health inequalities.},

  abstract = {Trust pervades human societies. Trust is indispensable in friendship, love, families and organizations, and plays a key role in economic exchange and politics. In the absence of trust among trading partners, market transactions break down. In the absence of trust in a country's institutions and leaders, political legitimacy breaks down. Much recent evidence indicates that trust contributes to economic, political and social success. Little is known, however, about the biological basis of trust among humans. Here we show that intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide that plays a key role in social attachment and affiliation in non-human mammals, causes a substantial increase in trust among humans, thereby greatly increasing the benefits from social interactions. We also show that the effect of oxytocin on trust is not due to a general increase in the readiness to bear risks. On the contrary, oxytocin specifically affects an individual's willingness to accept social risks arising through interpersonal interactions. These results concur with animal research suggesting an essential role for oxytocin as a biological basis of prosocial approach behaviour.},

  volume = {69},

  doi = {10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.05.013},
  abstract = {The association of self-rated health with mortality is well established but poorly understood. This paper provides new insights into self-rated health that help integrate information from different disciplines, both social and biological, into one unified conceptual framework. It proposes, first, a model describing the health assessment process to show how self-rated health can reflect the states of the human body and mind. Here, an analytic distinction is made between the different types of information on which people base their health assessments and the contextual frameworks in which this information is evaluated and summarized. The model helps us understand why self-ratings of health may be modified by age or culture, but still be a valid measure of health status. Second, based on the proposed model, the paper examines the association of self-rated health with mortality. The key question is, what do people know and how do they know what they know that makes self-rated health such an inclusive and universal predictor of the most absolute biological event, death. The focus is on the social and biological pathways that mediate information from the human organism to individual consciousness, thus incorporating that information into self-ratings of health. A unique source of information is provided by the bodily sensations that are directly available only to the individual him- or herself. According to recent findings in human biology, these sensations may reflect important physiological dysregulations, such as inflammatory processes. Third, the paper discusses the advantages and limitations of self-rated health as a measure of health in research and clinical practice. Future research should investigate both the logics that govern people's reasoning about their health and the physiological processes that underlie bodily feelings and sensations. Self-rated health lies at the cross-roads of culture and biology, therefore a collaborative effort between different disciplines can only improve our understanding of this key measure of health status.},

  abstract = {Income is related to health in three ways: through the gross national product of countries, the income of individuals, and the income inequalities among rich nations and among geographic areas. A central question is the degree to which these associations reflect a causal association. If so, redistribution of income would improve health. This paper discusses two ways in which income could be causally related to health: through a direct effect on the material conditions necessary for biological survival, and through an effect on social participation and opportunity to control life circumstances. The fewer goods and services are provided publicly by the community, the more important individual income is for health. Under present U.S. circumstances, a policy of counteracting growing income inequalities through the tax and benefit system and of public provision appears justified.},

  abstract = {This book presents G. A. Cohen's Gifford Lectures, delivered at the University of Edinburgh in 1996. Focusing on Marxism and Rawlsian liberalism, Cohen draws a connection between these thought systems and the choices that shape a person's life. In the case of Marxism, the relevant life is his own: a communist upbringing in the 1940s in Montreal, which induced a belief in a strongly socialist egalitarian doctrine. The narrative of Cohen's reckoning with that inheritance develops through a series of sophisticated engagements with the central questions of social and political philosophy.In the case of Rawlsian doctrine, Cohen looks to people's lives in general. He argues that egalitarian justice is not only, as Rawlsian liberalism teaches, a matter of rules that define the structure of society, but also a matter of personal attitude and choice. Personal attitude and choice are, moreover, the stuff of which social structure itself is made. Those truths have not informed political philosophy as much as they should, and Cohen's focus on them brings political philosophy closer to moral philosophy, and to the Judeo-Christian ethical tradition, than it has recently been.},

Results from four national panel surveys show that correlations among measures of SWB diminish over time, and that the SWB set points of a minority of individuals substantially change. These results mean that DE theory requires revision to make it more dynamic and enable it to better account for medium term change in SWB. The paper identifies personality traits and life events associated with subsequent changes in SWB. Data come from German, British and Australian panel surveys in which SWB has been measured for between 9 and 20 years. Panel regression random and fixed effects models were used to analyse the data.},

  abstract = {Using data on 697 individuals from 375 rural low income households in India, we test expectations on the effects of relative income and conspicuous consumption on subjective well-being. The results of the multi-level regression analyses show that individuals who spent more on conspicuous consumption report lower levels of subjective well-being. Surprisingly an individual's relative income position does not affect feelings of well-being. Motivated by positional concerns, people do not passively accept their relative rank but instead consume conspicuous goods to keep up with the Joneses. Conspicuous consumption always comes at the account of the consumption of basic needs. Our analyses point at a positional treadmill effect of the consumption of status goods.},

  title = {The {{Theory}} of {{Reflexive Modernization}}},
  volume = {20},
  abstract = {How can one distinguish the concept of second modernity from the concept of postmodernity? Postmodernists are interested in deconstruction without reconstruction, second modernity is about deconstruction and reconstruction. Social sciences need to construct new concepts to understand the world dynamics at the beginning of the 21st century. Modernity has not vanished, we are not post it. Radical social change has always been part of modernity. What is new is that modernity has begun to modernize its own foundations. This is what it means to say modernity has become reflexive. It has become directed at itself. This causes huge new problems both in reality and in theory. There has been a pluralization of the boundaries within and between societies, between society and nature, between Us and Other, between life and death. This pluralization also changes the inherent nature of boundaries. They become not so much boundaries as a variety of attempts to draw of boundaries. Border conflicts become transformed into conflicts over the drawing of boundaries. Where postmodernism simply celebrates this multiplication of boundaries, the theory of second modernity starts with the problem this new reality poses for individual and collective decisions, and with the problem that the continued existence of such decisions poses for theory. Institutions that are capable of such conscious boundary drawing are enabled in a way that those of the first modernity were not. But this process also generates qualitatively new kinds of trouble and crises. To investigate those troubles is to unveil the emergence of the second modernity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Even more surprising was the discovery that power-law distributions also characterize many biological and social networks. Many attributed a deep significance to this fact, inferring a ``universal architecture'' of complex systems. Closer examination, however, challenges the assumptions that (1) such distributions are special and (2) they signify a common architecture, independent of the system's specifics. The real surprise, if any, is that power-law distributions are easy to generate, and by a variety of mechanisms. The architecture that results is not universal, but particular; it is determined by the actual constraints on the system in question.},

  abstract = {Instead of the industrial production, which drove economic growth in the 20th century, the driver for growth in the 21st century is productivity in knowledge work and service businesses. For this reason, the authors developed a technique for measuring happiness using wearable technology. The research found a hidden signal representing a person’s happiness within the basic pattern of physical activity known as the “1/T rule.” This result uncovered a close relationship between the “trinity” of physical activity = happiness = productivity. Combined with a technique for using artificial intelligence to generate KPIs automatically, the technology can foster the ability of groups to engage in “co-creation” while also encouraging autonomy and commitment in individuals. This new technology is recognized as having the potential to open up new pathways in corporate accounting, production, and human resource systems.},

  abstract = {We present the design, implementation, and deployment of a wearable computing platform for measuring and analyzing human behavior in organizational settings. We propose the use of wearable electronic badges capable of automatically measuring the amount of face-to-face interaction, conversational time, physical proximity to other people, and physical activity levels in order to capture individual and collective patterns of behavior. Our goal is to be able to understand how patterns of behavior shape individuals and organizations. By using on-body sensors in large groups of people for extended periods of time in naturalistic settings, we have been able to identify, measure, and quantify social interactions, group behavior, and organizational dynamics. We deployed this wearable computing platform in a group of 22 employees working in a real organization over a period of one month. Using these automatic measurements, we were able to predict employees' self-assessments of job satisfaction and their own perceptions of group interaction quality by combining data collected with our platform and e-mail communication data. In particular, the total amount of communication was predictive of both of these assessments, and betweenness in the social network exhibited a high negative correlation with group interaction satisfaction. We also found that physical proximity and e-mail exchange had a negative correlation of r = -0.55~(p 0.01), which has far-reaching implications for past and future research on social networks.},

  isbn = {978-0-19-958829-9},
  abstract = {We are told that 'work is good for us' and that ill health is caused by 'individual lifestyles'. Drawing on research from public health, social policy, epidemiology, geography and political science, this evidence-based inter-disciplinary book firmly challenges these contemporary orthodoxies. It systematically demonstrates that work - or lack of it - is central to our health and wellbeing and is the underlying determinant of health inequalities. Work is the cornerstone of modern society and dominates adult life with around a third of our time spent working. It is a vital part of self-identity and for most of us it is the foundation of economic and social status. As such, the material and psychosocial conditions in which we work have immense consequences for our physical and mental wellbeing, as well as the distribution of health across the population. Recessions, job-loss, insecurity and unemployment also have important ramifications for the health and wellbeing of individuals, families and communities. Chronic illness is itself a significant cause of worklessness and low pay. Drawing on examples from different countries, this book shows that the relationship between work, worklessness and health varies by country. Countries with a more regulated work environment and a more interventionist and supportive welfare system have better health and smaller work-related health inequalities. The book provides examples of specific policies and interventions that mitigate the ill-health effects of work and worklessness. It concludes by asserting the importance of politics and policy choices in the aetiology of health and health inequalities.},

  abstract = {Industry and academia have repeatedly demonstrated the transformative potential of Augmented Reality (AR) guided assembly instructions. In the past, however, computational and hardware limitations often dictated that these systems were deployed on tablets or other cumbersome devices. Often, tablets impede worker progress by diverting a user's hands and attention, forcing them to alternate between the instructions and the assembly process. Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) overcome those diversions by allowing users to view the instructions in a hands-free manner while simultaneously performing an assembly operation. Thanks to rapid technological advances, wireless commodity AR HMDs are becoming commercially available. Specifically, the pioneering Microsoft HoloLens, provides an opportunity to explore a hands-free HMD’s ability to deliver AR assembly instructions and what a user interface looks like for such an application. Such an exploration is necessary because it is not certain how previous research on user interfaces will transfer to the HoloLens or other new commodity HMDs. In addition, while new HMD technology is promising, its ability to deliver a robust AR assembly experience is still unknown. To assess the HoloLens’ potential for delivering AR assembly instructions, the cross-platform Unity 3D game engine was used to build a proof of concept application. Features focused upon when building the prototype were: user interfaces, dynamic 3D assembly instructions, and spatially registered content placement. The research showed that while the HoloLens is a promising system, there are still areas that require improvement, such as tracking accuracy, before the device is ready for deployment in a factory assembly setting.},
